0,I had a really good day today!! Overcame a huge sadness that has been around for a few months and just had an amazing and happy day in for the first time in a while! Iâm really happy,0
1," Like most people here, I've experienced significant weight gain since starting Seroquel a few months ago, to the point where I'm considering changing meds. I've spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns I have surrounding it, but they seem to believe that it's not that bad, that I need to gain weight anyway so I might as well let it happen. While I do have a thin frame, that's a natural thing, putting on weight won't make me grow out, I'll just get a belly and it won't look good, not to mention be unhealthy, but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain. Is there anything I can do to change their mind, or at least have something to stop the weight gain? No matter how much I eat I'll put on weight, I went a few days without food and still put on weight, I'mnot sure how bad it's going to get and I really need something to help.",1
2, What is the worst side effect of medication treatment you have experianced?,1
3,"I feel like my life is finally falling into place. Decent job, good grades in school and a lovely girlfriend. So happy I had to let out some steam in the restroom.",0
4," I was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars, all over both her wrists, both her forearms, upper arms, thighs, legs, ankles, stomach, just completely covered in them. This got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm, and I realised I'm that kid. I'm not completely covered in scars, but my ankles are scarred pretty badly, my arm, which is probably where most people look, is covered in cuts, scars and burns, I don't even hide it anymore because it's so hot (I'm talking like 42℃, where I physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out), and I'm that kid who people will stare at when he's walking to class, they might whisper to their friends about my arm, the teachers will see my arm and just assume that I'm just another emo, I don't even do anything in class because I'm so depressed that I just don't have the energy to work so I must just look like a massive poser. I'm always on the lookout for others with scars like mine, but there's nobody with them.",1
5,"After 4 years my hair is finally healed, & life is also getting much better. We find out if we get our house tomorrow, Iâve made leaps in the tattoo game, my kid starts kindergarten in the fall, we are expecting a new baby this spring too, and SO gets out of the military soon!

8," I posted on here a little while ago when I experienced a traumatic event in which I was pinned down and choked by a student in the special education classroom I work in, and I suspected I had developed PTSD. I posted again after I was officially diagnosed with PTSD last Monday. The anxiety is still pretty overwhelming. I still can't work. They had to up my Ativan dosage and refer me to a psychiatrist because of concerns that I may be developing panic disorder. Everything is a mess because between worker's comp and my regular healthcare people, there are so many people involved who have to be kept updated and have to communicate amongst each other in order for things to run smoothly.",1
9,Hereâs a picture of grass smiling to brighten up your day!,0
10," I'm scared to be awake, I'm scared to go to sleep, and I can't kill myself because I'm scared of what comes next. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.",1
11," I’m going through a lot right now. I’m not handling any of it well. I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I routinely see my psychiatrist once a week. About a month ago, something kind of triggered my PTSD. I’m not quite sure what it is but I disassociate a lot and have severe panic attacks often now. I also have a severe chronic illness that greatly impacts my day to day life, have had illness half of my life and it will never go away. I’m in university. At some point during the semester, my anxiety and PTSD won. I stopped doing all schoolwork. I’ve been doing NOTHING for months. There were short weeks where I would make a rare appearance in my courses, my professors always perplexed as to why I show up and why I don’t.",1
12,This is my and my friend after almost a year of not seeing her. I surprised her for her birthday after setting up a surprise party and flying across the country.,0
13," It's hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm feeling really bad, it feels like my body is slightly vibrating. It only happens if I've been at a bad low for a really long time and I've been really inactive, probably laying in bed bc my body is aching so bad. Anyone else experience this, or am I alone in this?",1

16," I’ve mentioned it a couple times on here lately, but my depression has been ruining most parts of my life, including job performance. I’ve got a meeting in the morning with my bosses about my poor performance and I think I’ll be fired. Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and I’m desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.",1
17,"After learning to read, he couldn't wait after his trip to the library!",0
18," I can’t be intimate. I am too scared, insecure, ashamed, guilty. I try to be, but then I just leave. I can’t feel it the way I am supposed to. I just feel so so so much shame. I don’t ever want to have sex. It’s just so scary. I love my spouse and it’s ruining what is otherwise a perfect marriage. I’m in EMDR therapy but god I want to be aroused so fucking bad. I was able to be so in the past when we first started dating, but ever since he’s been my provider I can’t stop being scared. I don’t know what to do.",1
19," Just curious if anyone has felt this or can relate to this. Long story short I lost my job at the start of they year (poor performances, disorganized, etc), second in a row. Finally went to the behavioral health place in town and was diagnosed with Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. Great. Ever since I was fired I’ve felt completely paralyzed on where to go from here. I have no college, no skills, nothing. I’ve worked two kinds of jobs, factories and offices. I could never keep up with the office jobs (see above), and factories make me MISERABLE. It’s nothing against that kind of work, it’s me. Overtime, overnights, the danger, everything about it for some reason made me so sad I couldn’t stand it.",1
20," I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I also have a severe chronic illness (Ulcerative Colitis) that effects my quality of life every single day. Most importantly before anything else, I am not in danger of harming myself. This past week I’ve been having disassociating episodes. I’m not sure if that’s even the right terminology. I had one 4 days ago that was the worst I ever experienced, I didn’t even feel comfortable enough driving since I was so out of it. Once I snapped out of that funk, I thought I was going to be ok. But since then I’ve had more and more issues with dissociation, including right now. I am so overwhelmed with depression and anxiety that I feel like I can’t physically move from my desk which is where I’ve been almost all day. I’m so overwhelmed that I couldn’t even watch Netflix. It’s like I’m having a depressed panic attack. I can’t snap out of it.",1
21,"My wife is out of town. I will be 70 in April. I made these Apple Chips all by myself. They are so hot that /r/FoodPorn blocked it for being too much for SFW.

23,"After the few years of struggles with my son and his father, I have completed my taxes, filing my child as a dependent and am so grateful for the amount I received. This will go to my savings for my two year plan of opening up my own daycare! I feel one step closer to finally getting my life together!! 
Started school, saving 1/4 of every paycheck! It's been tough but eventually will all be worth it!",0
24," My CPTSD stemmed from long standing and extremely harsh physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of my dad. I have had some nightmares related to the trauma, but as I get more into the therapy and whatnot, I have just been having nightmares out of control.",1

26," A few weeks ago I was on a train. Some guy got on about an hour into the ride of three hours with his girlfriend. They sat down and she was being quite loud so I looked over for a second instinctively and he shouted at me. I just ignored him and went back to my music. Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me. I was quite afraid that he would be getting off at my stop and I wasn't sure what to do so I held onto my bag securely and started going over all the scenarios in my head that could happen, what he wanted and everything like that.",1

30,"I'm in my college dorm room as a first year. I was having a hard night, and suddenly I heard my roommate start giggling. She has headphones in, and is laughing at some video on her phone. Pure, unbridled joy. It reminds me of my little brother back home. 

See, my little bro back home is a freshman in high school, who plays video games... but he doesn't rage quit. When he dies, he laughs. He doesn't stress it, he thinks it's funny how close he got. He's such a cheery guy and his laughter is so contagious. It'll be midnight, and I'll just hear uncontrollable giggling from the next room over. He has no idea how much it makes my night. 

I didn't realize how much I missed hearing laughter late at night until right now. I love my little brother and he makes me truly happy. (:",0
31," I've been diagnosed with both Borderline Personality Disorder as well as PTSD. I saw a trauma specialist today for the second time and he said that I might not even have borderline at all and that it could just be really bad PTSD, so I'm a little confused on what my diagnosis is supposed to be.",1
32," Ever since developing PTSD, I've found that the list of movies and TV shows I can't watch just gets longer and longer. I've never been into horror or anything anyways, but I did used to watch some fairly intense and suspenseful shows, and I can't do that anymore, at least right now.",1

37, It is so hard to get up some days but I'm pretty sure my parents think I'm just making excuses to be home. I try to go if I can but some days I just can't. They don't understand...,1
38," I’ve been going through stuff a normal teen like me shouldn’t be going through. I live in a small house with one little sister and my parents. I also live with my nieces and nephews. I must admit I have a great life. Honestly I have clothes, food, a roof, a loving family, a boyfriend that loves me and amazing friends but of course I’m selfish so I can’t see that because it’s too little. I guess it’s like why is she saying goodbye nothing is wrong,, well there is...My sister is in jail and expects me to do everything and that means I go to court, I support her two kids so I’m basically a mom at the moment as well as sending her care packages and placing money on her books. The reason I do that is because my mom is dealing with too much. We have financial issues as well as too many kids to support. We barely get enough food and go shopping for clothes. ",1
39," I'm currently sitting in a bathroom stall at my high school that I've only been at for a few weeks, thigh bleeding from the three cuts I made about 10 minutes ago. I don't even know what class I'm meant to be in right now, I'm just so fed up with everything, I just don't have the energy to try and put the effort in anymore. I just feel so fucking empty, and I feel like there's no point to any of this. Why should I show up to class if it doesn't even matter in the lifetime of the universe? So I might get detention, or suspended, or expelled. Who cares. I'm only year eleven and my life has fallen apart and I can't seem to put it back together again.",1
40," I'm not a fan of self diagnosis, and I'm currently seeing a therapist and have been professionally diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, but I know that there's something else wrong with me. I have so many weird issues that can't be explained by depression and anxiety, like sometimes feeling like I'm not real or like I'm in a dream or something, and my fight or flight response it literally just freeze or accept what's about to happen and brace for it mentally. I've gone through trauma in the past that caused me to have intense flashbacks and I've undergone EMDR treatment. Sometimes I feel really paranoid and disconnected from reality. ",1
41,I'm 15 and my parents are split up. Anyway I've been really stressed because I do band and sports and school is hard. My mom also has obvious favorites so she hates me. Today I finally told my dad how I feel. This was his response. First time he's ever told me he was proud of me (more in comments),0
42,"My happy Sunday morning experience

With the storm in the UK being in full swing this morning I got up with the dreaded Sunday feeling and a slight hangover.

I looked out the window and saw the rain coming in sideways and battering the road below. In the distance I saw a couple dressed head to toe in waterproofs and looking pretty miserable. At their feet I saw a black Labrador who was having the best day ever!!!

The wetter the better for this guy and he was trundling down the road looking as though this was the highlight of his life.

Not much of a story for some but it this doggo really made me smile so thought Iâd share it.",0
43, What are your thoughts on medical marijuana? Is it a good or a bad thing for suffers of PTSD?,1
44,I got meningitis that put me in a coma with a 1.4 million dollar bill and no insurance. It ate up everything we saved to build our home including what we had saved for septic and a well. Weve been using a bucket for a toilet and hauling water to drink and cook. After digging and scraping by for years we are finally getting donations on our go fund me for water and septic! I was so excited when i saw the first donation come in weve raised $400 so far. Hopefully my kids can bathe at home and use a regular toilet this summer!,0
45," I got married in July, and was very excited. In the post-calm and happiness of the wedding, I started to experience my first nightmares and flashbacks and my life was finally stable enough for my mind and body to cope with my trauma. So here is what is happening to the heart for a PTSD survivor!",1

49," I'm currently in a psychiatric ward for the first time in my life, I arrived yesterday and I'm here for three weeks because apparently I'm just fucking insane or something. It's a youth hospital, ages 16 to 30, and I've been scanning the other patients arms for signs of self injury. I have many scars myself, most are hidden as they're on my thigh or ankles and I wear jeans all the time, but my arm is also pretty butchered from wrist to elbow. Today in group therapy I was just casually scanning everyone's arms, as us self harmers do, and I saw that the girl next to me had a few spots on her arm that looked to be caused by skin picking. I looked over to my left and saw a guy who had sleeves that he had rolled up to reach his elbows, and I saw a pretty large amount of scars from cutting and burning on both of his arms, and they were very bad, like some scars were very deep.",1
50," So I'm a male, I'm 16, and I was thinking today (bad idea, I know), I was thinking about the previous school I was at, and I remembered something quite traumatic that happened to me in year 9, when I was 14. I'm not sure how I didn't remember this until now, but it's possible that my brain forced me to forget it. Okay, so, in year 9 I had really terrible anxiety and that made me an easy bullying target, and I was bullied very badly, but one kid in particular went a bit overboard. I sat next to this kid, I'll call him Angus. I sat next to Angus in history due to our seating arrangement, and every lesson he would make sexual actions towards me. It started off mild, like he'd just say quietly that he wanted to kiss me or sleep with me, creepy shit like that, but then it got worse. He began to touch me. Quite inappropriately.",1
51,This dog at my school for Feel Good Friday,0
52," I feel horrible, I can't feel my legs and I just feel really angry and anxious and like there's a bee hive in my chest. I already took my meds but it hasn't done anything",1
53," So, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a severe generalized anxiety disorder, but I've been having some symptoms over the last year and a half that don't seem to fit into those categories. I've been experiencing a very extreme fluctuating mood, I can go from feeling extremely elated and invincible, having so many thoughts and ideas running through my head, talking very fast, having extreme amounts of energy, and feeling oddly irritated with people, to feeling horribly depressed and empty. I'm extremely impulsive, which has lead to me basically covering my body in self harm cuts and scars in less than a year, along with just randomly tying a noose up and hanging myself, not even necessarily because I really want to be dead, but just to see if I will die this time.",1
54,Cheers to my surprise dinner delivery from my favorite! Happy surprises!,0
55, I have PTSD from being attacked by an intruder to my home. Now whenever I am upstairs and home alone I hear someone downstairs. Ive ran downstairs to look multiple times and no one is ever there.

56,"I always thought it wouldnât happen because getting a Green card is so fricking complicated but a few days ago,

58,Found this under a house we were remodeling,0
59," I took an IQ some months ago and results were that I have a slow processing speed and working memory. Prior to that I was diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt. In the hospital I was really relieved to learn that the problems I was so sick and tired of was due to depression and anxiety stealing resources from important parts of the brain. So, ever since, I've been hoping that my ""stupidness"" problems that are caused by depression will eventually go away but I've been on antidepressants and therapy for months. The main doctor there said I would feel the full effects of my antidepressent Welbutrin after a month, but it's been 7 months now and I'm honestly no different than before. I'm better than I have been out of the hospital and prior to the suicide attempt, but I'm exactly where I was 365 days ago. ",1

64," I'm overwhelmed, having constant panic attacks. I just want to be asleep where I can't feel anything. I slept until 6pm. I haven't eaten in over 12 hours. I have no desire too. I'm drinking water. I have no energy to go downstairs and talk to anyone. I don't want anyone to bother me in my room. I'm not fighting it this time. It's gonna take over and i'm gonna let it. I'm just gonna lay here in bed on Netflix and playing games on my phone until it's time to take my sleeping pills again and sleep all day. Then dread to wake up and do it again. I'm tired of trying.

83," I posted on here recently about how I was choked by a student at work (I work with students with autism) and thought I might have developed PTSD... Well, Monday I was officially diagnosed. Tuesday night the anxiety got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. It has become this incredibly overwhelming situation because of all the insurance stuff and the many different health care providers involved, some of whom are worker's comp and some of whom aren't. People are suggesting I get an attorney. I have no family nearby. I'm almost out of money and I don't know how much I'll get paid this month because I've missed so much work, so I don't even know that I'm going to be able to afford to get to all of my doctor and therapy appointments (I don't drive due to a medical condition, so I pretty much have to take lyft/uber to all my appointments), let alone pay rent or buy food.",1

I have struggled with pretty severe self harm for about a year now, and I have covered myself in scars. I've made a couple of suicide attempts due to all of this, and I've noticed that recently (maybe over the past 9 months) I've been extremely short tempered and will get very angry at people for the slightest things, especially my parents. I've told them that I can't control the anger multiple times, but they keep just believing that I'm using that as an excuse to be an asshole.

I keep clenching my jaw, pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth and like sucking my cheeks in (almost like I’m imitating a fish). It’s been 12 hours since it’s started and I genuinely can’t get it to stop. It’s been so bad that my tongue is actually really starting to hurt. Has this happened to anyone else before??",1

In my current state(officially diagnosed bipolar, but not medicated or in therapy), I really don't see how I can come out this anywhere near ""OK"" if you would. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was a freshman in high school. I have even acted on these thoughts twice. The first time just a rope broke, second time I was rescued and brought to a mental institution where I was diagnosed. There's a very keen reason for why I have these thoughts, or so I think at least.",1

I know I have generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (both diagnosed by a psychiatrist), but I was referred to a psych ward a month ago with a diagnosis of bipolar 2 with psychotic symptoms by the same psychiatrist, then when I was there they diagnosed me with psychosis and said they don't think I'm bipolar, but they also mentioned something about a subtype of schizophrenia. I'm a 16 year old male if that helps at all. Basically, I've had anxiety issues ever since I was 5, I also had a lot of experience with having auditory hallucinations at the same very young age, they went away eventually but my anxiety stayed and began getting worse.",1

Well, they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures. I’d never talked to them about my depression, and how it’s ruining every part of my life, not just work. I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didn’t change anything. They don’t want me there. They sent me home to think about it, and they’re having an HR rep call me later to discuss my options.",1
297," So, I went to the the local mental health place early last year for depression, anxiety, and adhd (inattentive). I was tested and diagnosed with all three, started seeing a psychiatrist and have been taking medication for them since. I think it’s helped some, adhd a lot, depression a little, and anxiety not really. I’ve got a check in with the psychiatrist in the morning.

307, Went to the ER but chickened out at the last minute and told them I was there for stomach pains. I’m currently waiting for test results to come back. I know there’s nothing wrong with me physically. I’m just such a coward and was afraid of being admitted to inpatient psych again. I know my family will be disappointed in me.,1
308," Well I had eventually had enough, and told my parents. They confronted him (and his girlfriend) about it, but he lied and said he never did anything like that. I had messages on Facebook to prove it, but both him and his girlfriend said that I altered them using an app and was just looking for attention. My family remains friends with them and I’m no longer allowed near them for my own safety.",1
309," I'm aware I have depression so some of these thoughts may not make any sense, but I just want to describe how I feel and I feel angry, disappointed, ashamed, and you know if I told my therapist or doctors how I feel their immediate response would be 'oh it's just your depression' but then when their are reasons underlying why I feel this way it can't just simply be symptoms of 'chemical imbalances'. I wouldn't want to die if my brain was fucked and everything around me was fine but it seems my brain is fucked and everything is fucked.",1

314," Same old story, grabbed my lighter after a few months clean, had a smoke but it didn't help so decided to cook my leg. I was sitting on the couch next to my dog who was lying there, about to fall asleep when I burnt myself, a bit into me making the burn he shot up and stared at me, I thought he was interested in the sound the lighter made but he was looking at me, not the lighter, making those big sad puppy eyes we all know from many nights of refusing to give our dogs a second dinner. Once I'd finished I tucked my lighter back into my pocket, sat there for a bit and after 20 seconds or so I started to slam my fist into my leg repeatedly out of frustration and he properly sat up, once i stopped he continued to give me this really sad look, I was sitting there for a few more minutes but he kept looking at me instead of going back to sleep, which isn't something he ever does. I tried to pat him until he would lie down again but he wouldn't, I eventually got up and walked off but he kept looking at me the whole time with the same sad eyes.",1

316," I'm 13 and I have been hearing thought-like voices for some time now. I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago and am on Zoloft. I have a therapist too. I also cut. The voice curses a lot and tells me that I'm worthless and stupid. I can't stop it talking once it starts it only goes away when it wants. Als o, I wish on everything and strongly believe it will come true, and I get mad at the 'wish gods' or 'stars' when they don't. My question is, do I have some kind of scitzoaffective or schizophrenic disorder. If there are any further questions, feel free to ask me.",1
317,"I havenât seen the person I love in about 4 years. (unrequited love).

I saw this person who resembled you at very late at night (4 AM) at a dance party. They looked like you and danced the way I imagined you would have, because I recall you telling me that you loved dancing. She looked so happy, and that made me happy, too

Yes, I will be forever hurt knowing that I will never have you in my life, but it made me so happy seeing what I thought to be you, and knowing that you are living your life and hopefully doing well. 

Thank you stranger! You made me imagine what it would of been like for us to be there together and sharing in that moment. I have been smiling ever since :)",0
318," This new medication, Wellbutrin, has me moving in my sleep a lot. I've kicked my legs when I was covered in bugs. Punched my partner when I was actually punching my step dad.

I asked why I couldn't hug him and he said he didn't want to and continued walking.",1
319," So basically, it all started after reading about Chester Bennington's suicide, about 7 months ago, then I started having intrusive thoughts about it, then I googled it, started reading about depression, then I had a major panic attack, to the point of vomitting.(Yes, I know this is a typical trigger for OCD and this is how it usually starts, I had OCD episode 5 years ago, but can't remember exactly if it was the same.) Anyway, here is what happens.",1
320,"Me and my girlfriend have been together almost 6 months now and honestly just having her in my life makes everything 10 times easier.

321," So I'm sitting at the kitchen table, and my best friend is sitting across from me. And my mind starts spinning. I have a delusion that my friends, and family are going to be killed by someone and replaced with look a likes. So I start believing they took her too, so her defense (of course) was that she was the real her. But in my head I just knew the fake her would say something like that. So to prove that she was her she decided to play footise with me. It worked.",1
322," One of my friends lost his brother to suicide 20 years ago and has still not completely dealt with/""gotten over"" (I hate using that term with reference to someone/something that has died) it. My depression has become significantly increased in the last 4 months or so, and my friend has noticed this. He told me one day, with as serious of a look on his face and tone in his voice that I've ever seen, that if I ever try to kill myself and he finds out about it, he will cut me out of his life for good. Completely cut off communication with me, never want to see me again.",1
323," I’ve been told by close friends and family that I tend to disassociate, but I’m not really sure if I do or not. I’ve never been told any of this by a psychologist or anyone certified to diagnose. Also, I don’t think that I’ve been in a traumatic event. I was in an very toxic romantic relationship not so long ago but it never got to physical abuse it was really emotionally draining and hurtful, though.",1
324," So I work at a Jr high school. We have one incredibly emotionally unstable student. He will come in to the counseling office (where I work as the nurse) and just WAIL. It’s not normal crying, and he can turn it off and on like a switch. So several days during the week he will come in and “turn on” this wail. The kid “turns off” the wail as soon as his mom complies with what he wants. He is extremely manipulative. The wailing though. It brings me right back to the abuse. The wailing sounds exactly like myself and my siblings when we were suffering the abuse. Yesterday, he was in the office just screaming and wailing, and we had to have 6 police officers come in and try to manage it before he was taken to a hospital. It caused a panic attack. ",1
325," The ward is a couple of hours away, so it'll be a long drive. I'm kind of excited in a weird way, I might finally be in the hands of people who can help me. I was recently diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, which was a bit surprising, I always thought I just had depression/anxiety, but I guess this explains those periods of time where I am extremely energetic to the point where I begin being extremely impulsive and basically idiotic. My cutting will finally be put under control, no more covering myself in scars to purposely ruin my body. At least, no more of that for a few weeks. It'll be an interesting experience. It'll fuck with my schooling a fair bit but my mental illnesses already fucked over my education enough anyway, and this might be a start to my recovery. ",1

I know I've got anger issues but there are so many things in this world, so many harsh comments and looks that I get from people that just make me so angry with everyone. I'm tired of being expected and pressured to fit into everyone else's mold without question.

I can’t fall asleep naturally. I take Xanax, ambien, and over the counter sleepaids to try and sleep. I’m tired of seeing the sunrise every morning. I’m tired of watching the days waste away before me because I’m so useless. I’m useless from the insomnia, the depression, anxiety and lack of motivation. My chronic illness has destroyed my life, the resulting PTSD has only made it worse.",1
331, I've had the weirdest feelings lately. I don't want to do anything social but at the same time I want to do stuff. The few things I like to do I'll do and then after feel like I wasted my time and it was dumb. I'm just so conflicted I hate feeling this way.,1
332," But goddamn if it doesn’t help me so so SO much. I literally hate going into that office, sitting down, using the tappers, visiting my trauma. I hate shaking after, I hate the nightmares induced. But wow. I am already so much more than who I was when I started 2 months ago. Things are just.... healing. I don’t know how to explain it. But I am so SO proud of myself for doing this. I can feel myself loving my spouse more, loving strangers more, loving myself more.",1
333," Because of my depression I often don't want to do anything with any of my friends and often times when they text in the group chat if we wanna hang I don't respond. I don't want to do anything like I said, but at the same time I feel so shitty when I don't get invited or get left out. It's understandable why they don't invite me sometimes I get it. Anyone else like this?",1
334, I live in small town South Dakota and I absolutely HATE it. I think this largely contributes to my depression. I already don't wanna go do anything but then when's it's below 0 half the year it makes it even harder. Also even if I feel like doing something there is hardly anything to do with friends other than movies. It is even harder to stay here especially after visiting LA this summer and absolutely loving it. I am in no position to move either being I am 16 living with my parents. Anyone else think where they live contributes to their depression.,1

I have this curtain way of making them that I love so much :) First, instead of using cooking spray on the pan, I use butter to add to the flavour of the pancake. I make the batter as normal, then I add cinnamon into the batter. Once I put it onto the pan on the stove, I put in white chocolate chips and sometimes blueberries.

343," I've had a migraine for the past two days and my depressions been kind of bad lately, like I haven't showered in 4 days and ive mostly been lying in bed and sleeping a lot.

347," Like if I ever see an image of someone with their inner left forearm in view and it's completely unscarred I feel confused as to how they kept their arm like that, or if I see girls in bikinis at the beach with their thighs glistening in their clean majesty it makes me realise how I'll never look like that (mainly because I'm male but you get what I mean).",1

350," I don't think I'm actually depressed, I haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I have some serious motivational issues. I don't hate myself, and I think I could do so many things if I could just get going. I have a pretty decent body, after not working out for a year and eating like shit (barely at all) I can still do 60 push-ups in a minute. I have so much potential to work and I let it slide. There are so many things I could work towards, things I need to change about myself and the world I live in. It's not that I think I couldn't do it, I just can't get off of my ass to try.",1

356," My illness tends to present itself in a more delusional manner, with hallucinations being more scattered and nonsensical, but they're quite infrequent. However, I occasionally suffer from periods where they spike hugely, but they're all disconnected from each other. I just saw a dog run past when I was getting a bottle of water from the fridge, then began seeing a flashing light above me, and then when I walked down the hall I heard a voice, sounding kind of staticy, coming from my brothers room, all of these happened within a 40 second period. Should I be worried? I've had periods like this before, and I'm not particularly bothered by hallucinations unless they're keeping me awake or interfering with something I need to be doing, my delusions are much worse, but is there any way to avoid these little hallucination episodes?",1

361," I was recently diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), it hasn’t been letting me live my life properly and I’d love to get some help but when my therapist suggested meds I got scared and I don’t think I’ll take them. Multiple family members have used meds and antidepressants before and some of them didn’t get any side effects but the ones who did get them struggled a lot. I’m not 100% sure about taking them and I know that if I do I have a high chance of feeling better but I’d be risking myself to other problems and side effects.",1
362," I have this weird habit of staring at my inner forearm in public and at home. The scars there are probably about 3 months to just over a year old, and I kind of like the way they look, which is probably weird but especially for me, because whenever I look at the scars on my outer forearm I hate them for being so visible and STILL so red after six months of ""healing,"" but the scars on my inner forearm almost... satisfy me. They aren't even very deep at all, nothing compared to my thigh, but I like staring at them anyway.",1

364," I’m not sure if this is allowed here in this sub but I don’t know who else to tell. Most people wouldn’t see this as an accomplishment but I’m sure many of my fellow anxiety friends can appreciate how much it takes to even make that phone call. I’m 23, in University and I start my final year of classes on Monday if that means anything. I saw this psychiatrist for about 6 months a little over a year ago. I had some intense medical issues (on top of my mental issues), I missed one appointment and I never went back. The psychiatrist was phenomenal and genuinely cared about my well being. She would sit with me for two hours to just let me talk, and validate my feelings. When I missed my appointment she sent me follow up emails just asking if I’m doing okay. My anxiety won and I couldn’t even reply to her kind emails.",1
365," I am apparently a pariah in my family now. My sister, who I have spent countless hours consoling over the phone and financing her divorce from her ‘abusive’ husband, broke my nose. My grandpa died. He’s the only grandpa I’ve ever known. My sister, who lives in a different state, needed to fly into my state for the funeral. I am closest of my family (for some reason THEY ALL FOLLOWED ME HERE) so I offered to house her and take her to the funeral.",1
366," A lot of my fear of intimacy and relationships comes from my trauma warped perception that relationships are supposed to mirror my abuse as a child. For years I correlated being in a relationship with having no autonomy over myself, my thoughts, needs, and feelings don't matter, and that I am completely powerless. But yesterday I realized that I have these beliefs because my brain had equated the abuse I faced as a child, to what being in a relationship will be like. As a kid, I remember having this deep feeling of dread at the thought of ever being in a relationship because I thought any kind of romantic relationship in the future would just mean a continuation of what was happening to me at the time, and meant that I'd lose ownership over myself again and be completely powerless.",1

This really hit me because since I've been diagnosed with mental illnesses (anxiety and depression), my entire personality has disappeared. I used to be really funny, outgoing, sociable, friendly, fun to be around... you know just genuinely cool (early 20s). Now I'm just an irritated, unstable, difficult to be around, mental nightmare (late 20s).",1

371," I've been stuck with my problems for so long that communicating them is difficult. I have almost nobody I can candidly talk to about what I'm feeling. Except for this guy I met here on reddit almost 4 years ago, he knows all I've been going through. I vent to him sometimes but I really don't want to bother him too much so I've cut back a lot. I wouldn't count on him as a super reliable friend, he tends to leave my messages on read to end the conversation, and there's also a sexual aspect to our relationship. I don't quite count him as a friend, as most of our communication is through text, although we met in person 3 times 3 years ago. We don't talk frequently, so it often feels like I am alone.",1

Took a psychological evaluation and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. It also showed my “executive functioning” was “severely deficient” and that I’m likely asocial. I met with a psychiatrist who wants to start with ADHD meds and go from there.

Think about how things *really* might be in advance. Donât tell yourself how you want them to be. Donât lie to yourself as a form of motivation. Be honest.

If they end up being better than you expect , then wonderful. If they end up being anything else? Well, youâre prepared now.

Better to be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly surprised. Better to be realistic than delusional.

They're definitely not as bad as they were when I was unmediated but they still bother me regularly, and it made me wonder if this is normal or if my medication should be blocking them more than it is.

544," Hey guys. So I don't post here often, but I suffer from ADHD, depression and anxiety. So long story short, I was diagnosed around October although I should have been diagnosed a long while ago. So the first thing I went in for was ADHD. It took me this long to go in for this (I'm a sophomore in high school) mainly because although I couldn't pay attention I was smart enough to do well if that makes sense. And the main reason I actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers. But as I got older, starting around middle school, the material was getting harder so I had to pay attention to do as well as I normally did. And then I hit my lowest lows in high school, particularly this year. ",1

566," Lately I've lost a lot of weight and haven't been eating, like I'll get hungry but I just don't feel like eating, so I'll just wait for the hunger pains to go away by themselves. I didn't really see a problem with this until people started pointing out that they never see me eating and that I'm starting to look unhealthily thin, even tho I can't really tell if I look thin or not. I've been weighing myself daily and my normal weight used to be 125 lbs. And I was around that weight pretty consistently for the past few years, but lately I've gone down to 110 lbs. And I personally haven't been able to see the difference if it wasn't for the people pointing it out. But I want to keep losing weight, because I want to see the number on the scale get lower. I've had anorexia in the past so my mom has been getting worried about me and asking me to eat more because I'm starting to look unhealthy again. I'm not sure what I should do, because I don't want to be anorexic again because the recovery processis hell, but at the same time I'm afraid of gaining weight.",1

The moment I start to think about all of what's been going on, both in my world and in my head, things fall apart. I promised myself that I would stop doing bad things, that I wouldn't harm myself or go back to the hospital, that I would try to live a normal life. Hell, it may look normal from the outside, but there's nothing normal about me.",1
570," I feel afraid to talk to them because I worry I'm just boring them and I keep looking for signs that they all hate me, to a point where I make the most bizarre things into conclusive proof that I'm better off alone instead of bothering others with my existence. I worry that whenever they're alone they just talk about how fucked up I am and it terrifies me because for all I know they're going to randomly reveal that they've just been faking our friendship all along and I won't have anyone and I will genuinely be completely out of reasons to live.

573," In my opinion, anxiety didn't majorly affect me before. When I was first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety nos, I had a few symptoms. For example, arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast. I was also diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, but I never really felt like I had it (I just think it's worth mentioning, I'm wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow). I started Zoloft at 14 and took it until last August, then I went through some medication changes. When I switched to Lexapro, I was okay for the first two months. Then something changed, I started not feeling like myself. One day I just started feeling off while studying for my exam, my vision went out of focus a little. This put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where things constantly felt off, disconnected and detached.",1
574," I’m currently taking Lamictal (bipolar disorder), Buspar (GAD), and Lexapro (depression, GAD). I find they work pretty well, except I have mood swings from Hell. I’ll be ok one minute and I’ll want to kill myself the next. It’s pretty terrible.",1

576," I thought I'd hit my limit a few months ago when I tried to kill myself, but compared to now those times seemed like heaven. I just can't live anymore. You can always say ""it'll get better, don't give up, you're stronger than this,"" that's all bullshit. I'm not strong, if I was strong I wouldn't have covered my whole body in self harm in the space of less than a year, I wouldn't have tried to kill myself, I wouldn't be such a failure, I have a psychologist, a psychiatrist, I'm on meds, my mum's supportive, I still feel the way I do. I'm weak, I'm so weak and useless. I had a horrible cutting incident last night, I carved ""failure"" into my thigh then cut like mad from my thigh all the way up my hip. I cut at least 200 times and I'm planning something similar tonight. I'm so scared. I know what I can do to myself and I'm scared because I know I'll do it. I don't deserve to feel this way.",1

578," My depression has always involved a lot of self blame, guilt, and self hatred, as well as anger and emptiness. I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me. I'm having urges to sneak in one day (school is out where I live currently) and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything I can find in that shithole. ",1

580," My PTSD is caused by many traumas I dealt with in school, because of this going to school is nearly impossible, I get shakes, sweaty, I get horrible memories swirling around in my head over and over, I become paranoid, delusional, feel unsafe and like someone is going to hurt me, I hear voices that aren't there, I just cannot deal with it. Last year when I was attending school regularly, I would cut and burn myself every single day, many times, I tried to hang myself, I had breakdowns constantly, I ended up in a psych ward where I was told my depression had gotten so bad I was psychotic, all because of school. The very idea of having to go horrifies me, I haven't been in about 8 or 9 weeks, and I haven't tried to kill myself and I'm only cutting a couple of times a week, but I know my lack of attendance will come back to haunt me at some point.",1
581," My thigh is so badly scarred there are like fifty layers of scarring and it's impossible to count how many there are because they overlap so much I don't even know how I managed to do so much damage over only like a year.

586," I was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year. I have visual, auditory, and physical hallucinations. Sometimes I believe my teeth are melting out of my head, other times I believe people are going to kill and replace my family. I have tons of hallucinations.

Some physical hallucinations include me tasting blood in my mouth, or feeling pain from an imaginary knife stabbing me. I am on medication, and self medicate with cannabis.",1
587," I've had major depressive disorder for many years now, and it got to the point sometime last year where I didn't have the energy or the ability to practice personal hygiene, such as showering daily or brushing my teeth. I got braces on a few months ago, and I am hopeless at caring for them. I never used to brush my teeth before I got them on due to my depression, and it's just dawned upon me that I haven't brushed my teeth in a very long time, like, at least a week, probably two. I'm already aware my teeth will probably be kind of fucked, but is there any chance I might not have those white spots on my teeth when I get my braces off?",1

I'm just conflicted on what to do because my therapist really wants me to do this program because she thinks it could really help me but I just can't get into it. Just being there makes me feel angry and irritable, and I don't know how to accept the program so I can actually gain something from it, because I have this weird superiority complex that makes me feel like I don't need this program and I don't know how to get over this, because deep down I just feel too scared and vulnerable to discuss my emotions infront of a group of people.",1

636," Ive had anxiety forever. I was diagnosed when I was 10 years old. I had trauma recently that resulted in PTSD. One thing that my therapist said and I think everyone needs to hear is give yourselves credit for the days you win. A lot of us beat ourselves up over the days we have trouble being in public or getting out of bed. But we need to give ourselves credit for the days we get out of bed, the days we do the thing we have been avoiding, the days we win. Its hard to do these things when experiencing trauma.",1
637," 2019 was quite simply, the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with clinical depression late 2017, but the problems surmounted the past year. Came back home after graduating, thought things would finally change. But..bad breakup with the love of my life, unemployment and repeated repeated rejections, problems at home, had a ligament tear....it goes on and on. Wanted to start afresh the new decade, but it just plummeted lower and lower. Interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still haven't been gotten back to, so I think that's that- my last chance at some redemption is gone, im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment. Been shutting myself off everything, but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going. We were on the terrace smoking a fag, and at a time it was only me there. Then all the pent-up frustration let loose. All the failures had taken a toll, and I broke down. Went to the edge, said some words and was just ABOUT to jump when I saw s mething flash by me. A white trail of light. Wasn't a bird, or paper, or anything. My mind became even more blank but instead of jumping, I staggered back and fell back on the floor.",1

640," My Mental HELL began 2 months ago. I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely. I don't know why. I don't know how. I don't know what to do next. I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing. I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.",1
641," I try my hardest to act like everything is good, but it's not. I'm lonely and miserable. I get angry BECAUSE I'm lonely and miserable. If I died today, I know deep down that I'd be forgotten within 2 months. Not a word about me. I know why, but it still hurts to know how invaluable I am to everyone. I try so hard to fit in. To make new friends. There's just so much about me that's unlikable and I know that it's not the depression talking. I've seen it for myself, in people's eyes and in their body signals. I want to live. But unemployment, depression, sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living. I can't even see death as an escape. There is no escape for this. I'm going to be a shell no matter what.",1

646,"I'm an elementary music teacher, not a reading teacher. But I am helping out with the 3rd grade reading because I have some extra time in my day and I wanted to be useful.

During first quarter, only 24% of the 3rd grade students were on grade level to pass the state assessment. That is NOT good! So we worked really, really hard and devised some new interventions. We just got our test scores back from second quarter, and it jumped to over â of the students being on grade level! I'm so proud of them!",0

650," Does anyone else do this? I've self harmed in different ways throughout my life, as a kid I heard voices, had bizarre nonsensical paranoid beliefs and didn't know how to function in social situations, and I remember hitting myself in the head when I got stressed, or purposely pissing off my cat and then putting my hand near him and letting him tear it to shreds, or grinding my hand against a wall until it left marks. When I was 14 I began cutting, eventually began burning too, got a couple thousand scars as a result, I don't do it a ton anymore, but I've been punching walls daily for a while now, and I don't know why but it's just so satisfying. Getting pissed off and just being able to slam my fist into a wall, seeing the bruising, maybe even bleeding, it just feels good. I know I have potential to do real damage, and I've already accidentally knocked a tendon out of place doing it, but it just feels satisfying. Anyone else got experience with this?",1

653," I have diagnosed PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I have been on Prozac, Seroquel, and Xanax for the last few months. I’ve been struggling more the last few weeks especially with dissociation and anxiety. Today, my psychiatrist switched me from 1.5mg of Xanax a day to 3mg of Klonopin (up to). They’re dissolvable tablets. She also switched my Seroquel from 25mg a day to 50mg a day. My Prozac remains the same at 15mg a day. I’m nervous about trying Klonopin because I don’t know anything about it really. I’ve only been on Xanax throughout the years. Is there any major difference? Doubling the dose of Seroquel doesn’t make me too nervous but something about the switch to Klonopin does. Any advice is appreciated!",1
