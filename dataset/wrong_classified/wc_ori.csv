0,"I'm in my college dorm room as a first year. I was having a hard night, and suddenly I heard my roommate start giggling. She has headphones in, and is laughing at some video on her phone. Pure, unbridled joy. It reminds me of my little brother back home. 

See, my little bro back home is a freshman in high school, who plays video games... but he doesn't rage quit. When he dies, he laughs. He doesn't stress it, he thinks it's funny how close he got. He's such a cheery guy and his laughter is so contagious. It'll be midnight, and I'll just hear uncontrollable giggling from the next room over. He has no idea how much it makes my night. 

I didn't realize how much I missed hearing laughter late at night until right now. I love my little brother and he makes me truly happy. (:",0

2,"My happy Sunday morning experience

With the storm in the UK being in full swing this morning I got up with the dreaded Sunday feeling and a slight hangover.

I looked out the window and saw the rain coming in sideways and battering the road below. In the distance I saw a couple dressed head to toe in waterproofs and looking pretty miserable. At their feet I saw a black Labrador who was having the best day ever!!!

The wetter the better for this guy and he was trundling down the road looking as though this was the highlight of his life.

Not much of a story for some but it this doggo really made me smile so thought Iâd share it.",0

I was so excited when i saw the first donation come in weve raised $400 so far. Hopefully my kids can bathe at home and use a regular toilet this summer!,0

24,"They just taste amazing and I love making them so much. Idk why it makes me so happy? Maybe the smell?

I have this curtain way of making them that I love so much :) First, instead of using cooking spray on the pan, I use butter to add to the flavour of the pancake. I make the batter as normal, then I add cinnamon into the batter. Once I put it onto the pan on the stove, I put in white chocolate chips and sometimes blueberries. Lastly I serve them with blueberries ontop and some strawberries on the side and sometimes with whip-cream.

I'm eating the plate I just made now, I can't wait to be able to make them for a boyfriend/girlfriend some day :)",0

29,"This video taught a lot about happiness. This will definitely help [https://youtu.be/oFKeWMJEo\_o](https://youtu.be/oFKeWMJEo_o)

 âWhenever you are about to start on some activity, remind yourself what the activity is like,â 

 

Think about how things *really* might be in advance. Donât tell yourself how you want them to be. Donât lie to yourself as a form of motivation. Be honest.

If they end up being better than you expect , then wonderful. If they end up being anything else? Well, youâre prepared now.

Better to be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly surprised. Better to be realistic than delusional.

Thatâs the idea of this animated video, check it out.Â
