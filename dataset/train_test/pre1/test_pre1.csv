163,i often feel like all the parts of my life are very confusing i often get a distorted sense of time i will think it is pm at midnight for example and i often find my sense of reality to be very odd i struggle to know whether or not anything is real and if it is everything seems to blend together into one big slab of time where i am not there like i am watching it happen from somewhere else watching time speed by before my eyes i also tend to have very confused thoughts i will be speaking then suddenly forget what i was saying or even the topic of conversation or who i am talking to or i will just randomly say stuff that makes no sense and i do not know why,1

167,i have held a schizophrenia diagnosis for over a year now with my first psychosis being diagnosed almost years ago since then the people who know namely my family expect me to function exactly the same as if i was healthy even if i am in the middle of an extremely intense episode now a week ago i injured my knee my kneecap dislodged basically dislocated out of the blue quickly popped back in went to see my gp the next day and it happened again i am on crutches now since i can not walk on it and i am getting scans done it is likely that the recovery period will be a number of months with surgery playing a part since then everyone seems to be much more worried nobody expects me to be up and out of the house constantly nobody expects me to be fully functional and operating perfectly normally even though this knee is bothering me much less than my schizophrenia does on any given day and any psychotic episode is miles worse than not being able to walk and it is really quite depressing how little people care about anything mental health related,1

210,after a week off work with tonsillitis and a stressy week at work while recovering i am finally healthy enough to start knitting again,0
211,after having read about it i am just so disappointed that it is not acknowledged in the dsm for being too similar to ptsd even though from what i read complex ptsd occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting ptsd from that because you developed while surrounded by trauma and cptsd is even acknowledged by the va as a real disorder and i am just confused as to if it is ever going to be acknowledged or not,1
212,so i went to the doctor the other day for anxiety and depression she switched me from celexa to effexor xr as well as referring me to a psychiatrist counselor not sure i do not know if it is the switching meds or what but my depression is getting way worse my only experience with this kind of thing was in high school now i was a depressed kid and my dad insisted on a christian counselor the first session i actually opened up and then he invited my dad in and told him everything i would said with me in the room it was humiliating and really his only advice was to pray more i am not against religion at all but that probably was not the kind of help i needed,1
213,anyone else feel this way i personally am not always sad i would not say i am happy but i am just merely existing i am sad at times but not always i would more describe depression as feeling empty and meaningless and sadness is a symptom thoughts,1

407,first off im definitely not asking for medical advice not even looking to change anything im just curious if im prescribed like a lot of meds ive been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over a year i like him weve built up over time but it seems like every appointment another med gets added to be clear im not unhappy with the treatment i just dont know anyone with similar issues so i dont have anything to compare it to heres the breakdown,1

447,i have been told by several different sources that sometimes my eyes look dull or lifeless i was facetiming with my boyfriend and i could not help but notice it the whole time they look dark and lack emotion even though my facial expressions do the opposite meanwhile his eyes which are a darker color than mine looked like they were shining and i could see how much he adores me just by looking at them and now i am worried he thinks i hate him or something bc eyes are so telling they are what we look at to know what someone is feeling,1
448,i am glad people feel comfortable enough to talk to me about their problems but i seriously need a break i am also tired of my family acting like i can not be upset or annoyed with them i am not a therapist a guidance counselor or a life coach i can not help you like they can it is good to tell someone how you feel but i cannot handle everyones emotional baggage when i am still trying to fix myself,1
452,i was watching degrassi recently and a character was in the hospital for having what they thought oppositional defiant disorder i looked it up out of curiosity and it seemed way close to what i actually have well the mood swing part i feel like even after all these years i can not control myself and when i am having these episodes i can get really scary i get even worse when someone either laughs tries to argue with me or insists that i am a liar it is like it sets me off into this free range beast that has lost all morals and would love nothing than to see and feel the world burn,1

480,so i have been thinking a lot about my self harming recently i am days clean atm so of course i spend every second wanting to relapse and i have noticed that i was never too aware of why i was cutting as badly as i was i think that the reason i have done it so much in such a short space of time is that i get kind of curious to see how far i can go if that makes sense i sort of can not even feel the pain anymore i just do it out of curiosity if that makes sense i would sort of spread it out around my body and i got really curious to see how much i could take i am fascinated by how easy it is for me to fuck my body up for life and now i am starting to realise that i was seeing how far i could go how much i could cover myself in scars does anybody else get me or has anyone else felt the same way,1

495,i am finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death i have very specific means of torture ripping off their noses with channel locks stomping on their face repeatedely cutting all their tendons so they can not even fight back i just imagine myself beating them to the point they are begging to be killed then i would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death after that i would them stare in the eyes and kill them the blood the screams the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness i had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid,1
499,i have a severe anxiety and panic disorder it makes me super aware of my throat and i feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up i also have gerd this past year i have relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed i am working on therapy after the new year i do not know if it is my head but i am super aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag i do not know if this is my anxiety or gerd or even both but it is incredibly frustrating last winter i saw my doctor and i was gagging so bad in his office that i could barely talk he prescribed me rabeprazole and so i took it for a month or two and then stopped not sure why the gagging is back though and so today i took one i am hoping it does something and i am just thinking it is my anxiety and my head concentrating too much it is just frustrating because it is hard to eat i will be scared of eating and then gag ugh hopefully this made sense,1

573,in my opinion anxiety did not majorly affect me before when i was first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety nos i had a few symptoms for example arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast i was also diagnosed with adhd when i was but i never really felt like i had it i just think it is worth mentioning i am wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow i started zoloft at and took it until last august then i went through some medication changes when i switched to lexapro i was okay for the first two months then something changed i started not feeling like myself one day i just started feeling off while studying for my exam my vision went out of focus a little this put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where things constantly felt off disconnected and detached,1
575,life is what happens to you and how you react to it,0
578,my depression has always involved a lot of self blame guilt and self hatred as well as anger and emptiness i would always take it out on myself first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill then cutting myself which eventually stemmed into burning scratching and punching walls but recently i have been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past and especially my old school where a lot of very bad events happened to me i am having urges to sneak in one day school is out where i live currently and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything i can find in that shithole,1

585, last year midyear was one of the toughest times in my life leaving an industry i spent years developing only to leave and unexpectedly rediscover another has been such a fulfilling experience i am grateful for everything i have going for me right now,0
587,i have had major depressive disorder for many years now and it got to the point sometime last year where i did not have the energy or the ability to practice personal hygiene such as showering daily or brushing my teeth i got braces on a few months ago and i am hopeless at caring for them i never used to brush my teeth before i got them on due to my depression and it is just dawned upon me that i have not brushed my teeth in a very long time like at least a week probably two i am already aware my teeth will probably be kind of fucked but is there any chance i might not have those white spots on my teeth when i get my braces off,1
593,op had to help the kid create an ig account,0
599,i just want to die i am not brave enough to be suicidal but if i suddenly got shot or was diagnosed with a terminal illness i can not say i would be mad at all right now i am depressed and at an all time low my family has disowned me my daughter does not acknowledge i exist i have no friends and i can not even find a job hope is hollow and love is a lie,1
601,i have medication i take every day for my schizophrenia majority of the time it is a bit of a hassle to get to take them i get the idea that they are poison so my best friend likes to compare it to a video game where she does the right combos to get me to calmly and easily take my medicine and when i do she feels like she unlocks an achievement,1
606,i have been having extreme urges to break into my old school where i experienced a lot of pretty horrible things and i am not looking for people to tell me not to do it what i choose to do is my choice but has anyone else ever had those sorts of urges whether they relate to a person or a place or an object,1

628,for starters i am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and i am constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life it has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping i think if you are religious it can really help you with depression but i just need to find meaning in life and i do not think i could handle doing a job that does not relate to comedy because that is how i find joy in life man that was all over the place,1
629,i have severe anxiety and it blew up into really bad agoraphobia in the past year and a half i spend of my time confined in my room and with barely any social interaction i do not work and am on disability i have had dpdr a few times before when my panic attacks get really bad but lately i think its different like a smell or a tv show or something from a memory of my past will trigger the disconnected feeling and like i am back in that memory the memory is not even particularity traumatic i sometimes will watch tv or a movie and i feel like i am the character and then i start panicking and then that triggers the dpdr i feel like i am gonna go crazy i am scared what is this it it caused from my mind being idle and literally doing nothing but watching netflix hours a day my panic attacks are ruthless because i do not feel like myself at all,1
634,i was diagnosed with ptsd stpd and mdd when i was twenty two i would like to go to community college by next year what would be the best course for me,1
635,i posted this in the antidepressants sub but did not hear anything back so it is still early so maybe i just need to push through i would been on mg of citalopram for about years when i went to the doctor because my anxiety was getting worse she had me switch to effexor xr the very next day i have been on mg since and so far my anxiety is unchanged or worse and my depression is coming back hard i am feeling terrible about myself overwhelmed by everything and losing interest is basically everything i like to do normally i love to play video games for hours but now none of them are doing anything for me,1
637, was quite simply the worst year of my life i was diagnosed with clinical depression late but the problems surmounted the past year came back home after graduating thought things would finally change butbad breakup with the love of my life unemployment and repeated repeated rejections problems at home had a ligament tearit goes on and on wanted to start afresh the new decade but it just plummeted lower and lower interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still have not been gotten back to so i think that is that my last chance at some redemption is gone im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment been shutting myself off everything but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going we were on the terrace smoking a fag and at a time it was only me there then all the pentup frustration let loose all the failures had taken a toll and i broke down went to the edge said some words and was just about to jump when i saw s mething flash by me a white trail of light was not a bird or paper or anything my mind became even more blank but instead of jumping i staggered back and fell back on the floor,1
640,my mental hell began months ago i feel like something in my mind broke and do you know the reason i heard of someone who died by suicide since then my life changed completely i do not know why i do not know how i do not know what to do next i suddenly asked myself why he did it he had kids he had everything what kind of force drive him to suicide what stops me from doing it too and then i experienced something strange something confusing i have really hard time describing what is happening in my brainnearly impossible but i will try life feels meaningless without any apparent reason i am constantly anxious have less energy i do not go outside as i used to i am constantly in my home searching google articles about mental issues and so on i am constantly in my head,1
641,i try my hardest to act like everything is good but it is not i am lonely and miserable i get angry because i am lonely and miserable if i died today i know deep down that i would be forgotten within months not a word about me i know why but it still hurts to know how invaluable i am to everyone i try so hard to fit in to make new friends there is just so much about me that is unlikable and i know that it is not the depression talking i have seen it for myself in peoples eyes and in their body signals i want to live but unemployment depression sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living i can not even see death as an escape there is no escape for this i am going to be a shell no matter what,1
649,so after months of being scared of getting a boy haircut i finally showed my mom types she picked out the one i wanted the least it is a undercut so hidden but i get the shorter hair and i had my first therapy session which i was scared abt but i am excited to see her next week now i just need to get my grades up,0
650,does anyone else do this i have self harmed in different ways throughout my life as a kid i heard voices had bizarre nonsensical paranoid beliefs and did not know how to function in social situations and i remember hitting myself in the head when i got stressed or purposely pissing off my cat and then putting my hand near him and letting him tear it to shreds or grinding my hand against a wall until it left marks when i was i began cutting eventually began burning too got a couple thousand scars as a result i do not do it a ton anymore but i have been punching walls daily for a while now and i do not know why but it is just so satisfying getting pissed off and just being able to slam my fist into a wall seeing the bruising maybe even bleeding it just feels good i know i have potential to do real damage and i have already accidentally knocked a tendon out of place doing it but it just feels satisfying anyone else got experience with this,1
