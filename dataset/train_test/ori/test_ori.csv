11," I’m going through a lot right now. I’m not handling any of it well. I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I routinely see my psychiatrist once a week. About a month ago, something kind of triggered my PTSD. I’m not quite sure what it is but I disassociate a lot and have severe panic attacks often now. I also have a severe chronic illness that greatly impacts my day to day life, have had illness half of my life and it will never go away. I’m in university. At some point during the semester, my anxiety and PTSD won. I stopped doing all schoolwork. I’ve been doing NOTHING for months. There were short weeks where I would make a rare appearance in my courses, my professors always perplexed as to why I show up and why I don’t.",1

I was able to be so in the past when we first started dating, but ever since he’s been my provider I can’t stop being scared. I don’t know what to do.",1

30,"I'm in my college dorm room as a first year. I was having a hard night, and suddenly I heard my roommate start giggling. She has headphones in, and is laughing at some video on her phone. Pure, unbridled joy. It reminds me of my little brother back home. 

See, my little bro back home is a freshman in high school, who plays video games... but he doesn't rage quit. When he dies, he laughs. He doesn't stress it, he thinks it's funny how close he got. He's such a cheery guy and his laughter is so contagious. It'll be midnight, and I'll just hear uncontrollable giggling from the next room over. He has no idea how much it makes my night. 

I didn't realize how much I missed hearing laughter late at night until right now. I love my little brother and he makes me truly happy. (:",0
31," I've been diagnosed with both Borderline Personality Disorder as well as PTSD.

I don't even know what class I'm meant to be in right now, I'm just so fed up with everything, I just don't have the energy to try and put the effort in anymore. I just feel so fucking empty, and I feel like there's no point to any of this. Why should I show up to class if it doesn't even matter in the lifetime of the universe? So I might get detention, or suspended, or expelled. Who cares. I'm only year eleven and my life has fallen apart and I can't seem to put it back together again.",1

42,"My happy Sunday morning experience

With the storm in the UK being in full swing this morning I got up with the dreaded Sunday feeling and a slight hangover.

I looked out the window and saw the rain coming in sideways and battering the road below. In the distance I saw a couple dressed head to toe in waterproofs and looking pretty miserable. At their feet I saw a black Labrador who was having the best day ever!!!

The wetter the better for this guy and he was trundling down the road looking as though this was the highlight of his life.

Not much of a story for some but it this doggo really made me smile so thought Iâd share it.",0

49," I'm currently in a psychiatric ward for the first time in my life, I arrived yesterday and I'm here for three weeks because apparently I'm just fucking insane or something. It's a youth hospital, ages 16 to 30, and I've been scanning the other patients arms for signs of self injury. I have many scars myself, most are hidden as they're on my thigh or ankles and I wear jeans all the time, but my arm is also pretty butchered from wrist to elbow. Today in group therapy I was just casually scanning everyone's arms, as us self harmers do, and I saw that the girl next to me had a few spots on her arm that looked to be caused by skin picking. I looked over to my left and saw a guy who had sleeves that he had rolled up to reach his elbows, and I saw a pretty large amount of scars from cutting and burning on both of his arms, and they were very bad, like some scars were very deep.",1

I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm taking medicine for nothing. Before medicine I used to be very irritable and moody, it could have been depression but it also could have been my parents always making me upset. I find it really hard to explain how I'm feeling. I went to my psychiatrist yesterday and she asked me how long feelings of depression I have last. I couldn't really answer because I wasn't sure. I don't feel despair most of the time, I just feel...neutral. I feel like I just go through the motions everyday, no overwhelming feelings or depression or intense feelings of happiness. There's lingering sadness I guess, but it's not something I fixate on most of the day",1

I am 17 now and a couple months ago in addition to Wellbutrin prescribed 1 month before this, for my depression, I was prescribed Remeron to help with anxiety. After a weeks or two, I started missing doses and had my first panic attack which was just awful. For the first few minutes it felt like a heart burn which I used to get so I didn't think about it, I started rubbing my chest to alleviate the feeling then out of no where the attack came and felt like someone grabbed my heart and squeezed it. This was then followed my the feeling of my heart pouring out blood. And then then tension in the heart/chest area and dizziness for the rest of the day.",1

I would sometimes get physically sick over my own feelings, wouldn't be able to stop thinking about that person, etc. I even figured out where one boy lived when I was still in elementary school, and I would constantly ride my bike in front of his house hoping he'd notice me.",1

I also tend to have very confused thoughts, I'll be speaking then suddenly forget what I was saying, or even the topic of conversation or who I'm talking to, or I'll just randomly say stuff that makes no sense and I don't know why.",1

167," I've held a schizophrenia diagnosis for over a year now, with my first psychosis being diagnosed almost 3 years ago. Since then, the people who know, namely my family, expect me to function exactly the same as if I was healthy, even if I'm in the middle of an extremely intense episode. Now, a week ago I injured my knee, my kneecap dislodged, basically dislocated, out of the blue, quickly popped back in, went to see my gp the next day and it happened again, I'm on crutches now since I can't walk on it, and I'm getting scans done, it's likely that the recovery period will be a number of months, with surgery playing a part. Since then, everyone seems to be much more worried, nobody expects me to be up and out of the house constantly, nobody expects me to be fully functional and operating perfectly normally, even though this knee is bothering me much less than my schizophrenia does on any given day, and any psychotic episode is miles worse than not being able to walk, and it's really quite depressing how little people care about anything mental health related.",1

However they are very not understanding about mental illness at all. I've tried to explain to them over and over that the cure for bipolar isn't just ""toughen up"". I've tried educating them on the disorder but they think mental illness research is ""a bunch of liberal propaganda"".

Even though from what I read, Complex PTSD occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting PTSD from that. Because you developed while surrounded by trauma and C-PTSD is even acknowledged by the VA as a real disorder and I'm just confused as to if it's ever going to be acknowledged or not.",1
212," So I went to the doctor the other day for anxiety and depression. She switched me from Celexa to Effexor XR, as well as referring me to a psychiatrist/ counselor (not sure). I don't know if it's the switching meds or what, but my depression is getting way worse. My only experience with this kind of thing was in high school (33 now). I was a depressed kid and my dad insisted on a ""Christian counselor"". The first session I actually opened up, and then he invited my dad in and told him everything I'd said with me in the room. It was humiliating and really his only advice was to pray more. I'm not against religion at all but that probably wasn't the kind of help I needed.",1

Well, they said I could either resign or they would start termination procedures. I’d never talked to them about my depression, and how it’s ruining every part of my life, not just work. I tried my best to explain it and how it was effecting me (when I could pull myself together). They were very kind and understanding, but it didn’t change anything. They don’t want me there. They sent me home to think about it, and they’re having an HR rep call me later to discuss my options.",1

 âWhenever you are about to start on some activity, remind yourself what the activity is like,â 

 

Think about how things *really* might be in advance. Donât tell yourself how you want them to be. Donât lie to yourself as a form of motivation. Be honest.

If they end up being better than you expect , then wonderful. If they end up being anything else? Well, youâre prepared now.

Better to be pleasantly surprised than unpleasantly surprised. Better to be realistic than delusional.

407," First off I’m definitely NOT asking for medical advice, not even looking to change anything, I’m just curious if I’m prescribed, like, a LOT of meds. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for a little over a year, I like him. We’ve built up over time but it seems like every appointment another med gets added. To be clear, I’m not unhappy with the treatment. I just don’t know anyone with similar issues so I don’t have anything to compare it to. Here’s the breakdown",1

440," It took all of my willpower to not grab my phone and start texting him. I missed him so much. It was actually my idea for us to not talk for a bit. I was splitting on him too much and I needed to do some damage control before I completely lost him for good. In the past, I would have just blown up his phone until he forgave me or pitied me enough to talk to me again. But I told him myself that we shouldn't talk for awhile, and it helped! After a few days, he reached out to me first and we talked things over and we're getting back on good terms. I am so proud of myself.",1

I was a terrible high school student, and have worked a series of factory jobs I hated and office jobs I was terrible at since.

They look dark and lack emotion even though my facial expressions do the opposite. Meanwhile his eyes (which are a darker color than mine) looked like they were shining and I could see how much he adores me just by looking at them. And now I'm worried he thinks I hate him or something, bc eyes are so telling. They're what we look at to know what someone is feeling.",1

I looked it up out of curiosity and it seemed way close to what I actually have. Well, the mood swing part. I feel like even after all these years, I can't control myself and when I'm having these episodes, I can get really scary.

Problem is, I don't know where to start. I'm thinking something simple and part time, but even getting a part time job needs a lot of things I just can't do. For those of you who work, how did you start out?",1
480," So I've been thinking a lot about my self harming recently (I'm 15 days clean atm so of course I spend every second wanting to relapse) and I have noticed that I was never too aware of why I was cutting as badly as I was. I think that the reason I have done it so much in such a short space of time is that I get kind of curious to see how far I can go, if that makes sense. I sort of can't even feel the pain anymore, I just do it out of curiosity if that makes sense. I would sort of spread it out around my body, and I got really curious to see how much I could take. I'm fascinated by how easy it is for me to fuck my body up for life, and now I'm starting to realise that I was seeing how far I could go, how much I could cover myself in scars. Does anybody else get me, or has anyone else felt the same way?",1

I keep myself up at night thinking about horrible things and lately I haven't had the motivation to even take my antidepressants twice a day, I've been taking them once every other day if I remember to take them. I've been considering going on a higher dosage since I'm seeing my psychiatrist in a few days. But I'm not sure how to break this sleep cycle.",1
495," I'm finding myself frequently fantasizing about brutally torchering people to death. I have very specific means of torture. Ripping off their noses with channel locks. Stomping on their face repeatedely, cutting all their tendons so they can't even fight back. I just imagine myself beating them to the point they're begging to be killed. Then I would do the same thing to their loved ones just so they can also experience the psychological torment of seeing their loved ones tortured to death. After that I would them stare in the eyes and kill them. The blood, the screams, the pleading geninuinely brings my heart happiness. I had the living shit beaten out of me as a kid.",1
499, I have a severe anxiety and panic disorder. It makes me super aware of my throat and I feel gaggy when my anxiety flares up. I also have GERD. This past year i've relapsed into really bad panic attacks which triggered agoraphobia and most of my time is spent in my bed. I'm working on therapy after the New Year. I don't know if it's my head but I am SUPER aware of my throat all the time which then causes me to gag. I don't know if this is my anxiety or GERD or even both but it's incredibly frustrating. Last winter I saw my doctor and I was gagging so bad in his office that I could barely talk. He prescribed me Rabeprazole and so I took it for a month or two and then stopped. Not sure why. The gagging is back though and so today I took one. I'm hoping it does something and I'm just thinking it's my anxiety and my head concentrating too much. It's just frustrating because it's hard to eat. I'll be scared of eating and then gag. Ugh. Hopefully this made sense.,1
503," So I am suffering from ??intrusive?? thoughts about suicide. Last night I was laying in my bed and decided to go to the kitchen to smoke a ciggarete. I was relatively fine. I was sleepy.

515," I haven't been through enough to be as fucked up as I am. I can't function, I've gotta change schools because I'm just not going to school ever currently, I have no motivation to do anything, I just lie in bed all day wasting away, and I'm only 16. I've covered my body in self harm cuts, burns and scars, I've attempted suicide, I feel so emotionally unstable all the time, one minute I'm extremely depressed then I'll get extremely angry at the smallest of things then I'll go manic without warning and that'll keep happening over and over again, I'm just a huge disappointment. My parents are still together, happy, my mum tries to support me as much as she can, my dad doesn't really understand how I work so he doesn't help me much, but I live in a house, I have food, we might not have all the money we could ever want but we have enough to get by.

They agreed. Skip forward to today, and I wake up at 10 am to start cooking the food...only to find out that the food has already been cooked by my parents. I was immediately frustrated, I felt a bit betrayed. I know how to do this stuff, yet, they seemingly don't trust me with it. I held my tongue, started making the pumpkin pie.

570," I feel afraid to talk to them because I worry I'm just boring them and I keep looking for signs that they all hate me, to a point where I make the most bizarre things into conclusive proof that I'm better off alone instead of bothering others with my existence. I worry that whenever they're alone they just talk about how fucked up I am and it terrifies me because for all I know they're going to randomly reveal that they've just been faking our friendship all along and I won't have anyone and I will genuinely be completely out of reasons to live.

573," In my opinion, anxiety didn't majorly affect me before. When I was first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety nos, I had a few symptoms. For example, arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast. I was also diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, but I never really felt like I had it (I just think it's worth mentioning, I'm wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow). I started Zoloft at 14 and took it until last August, then I went through some medication changes. When I switched to Lexapro, I was okay for the first two months. Then something changed, I started not feeling like myself. One day I just started feeling off while studying for my exam, my vision went out of focus a little. This put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where things constantly felt off, disconnected and detached.",1

I would always take it out on myself, first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill, then cutting myself, which eventually stemmed into burning, scratching, and punching walls, but recently I've been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past, and especially my old school, where a lot of very bad events happened to me.

I got braces on a few months ago, and I am hopeless at caring for them. I never used to brush my teeth before I got them on due to my depression, and it's just dawned upon me that I haven't brushed my teeth in a very long time, like, at least a week, probably two.

617," Depression was barely even on my radar, I knew it existed but I didn't think it was common or that I would ever deal with it. I don't even know what I thought depression was, I might have just thought ""oh, you're just sad a lot."" Now I know how wrong I was.",1
618, Does anyone know when the proper time is to go to the hospital? I’ve been super depressed and suicidal lately. There are moments when it gets really intense and I feel I will follow through with it. It’s gotten to the point where I call the suicide hotline every day because I don’t know what else to do.,1
619," So tonight was maybe a breakthrough? My therapist says it sounds like I have PTSD as well as bipolar II. Does anyone else have this going on? The “bipolar” name really frightens me, but she says putting me on a mood stabilizer will really REALLY change my quality of life.",1
622,Thanks to EMDR therapy I feel something I havenât felt in almost 10 years: Hope for my future.,0
623,Haven't felt as good as I feel now in a very long time. So far in about a little over 4 months I've lost 80 pounds and am about 5 weeks till my weight loss surgery. My heaviest was 405 and weighed in at 325 this morning.,0
628, For starters I am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and I'm constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life. It has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping. I think if you are religious it can really help you with depression. But I just need to find meaning in life and I don't think I could handle doing a job that doesn't relate to comedy because that is how I find joy in life. Man that was all over the place...,1
629," I have severe anxiety and it blew up into really bad agoraphobia in the past year and a half. I spend 99% of my time confined in my room and with barely any social interaction. I don't work and am on disability. I've had dp/dr a few times before when my panic attacks get really bad but lately I think its different? Like a smell or a tv show or something from a memory of my past, will trigger the disconnected feeling and like i'm back in that memory. The memory isn't even particularity traumatic. I sometimes will watch tv or a movie and I feel like i'm the character and then I start panicking and then that triggers the dp/dr. I feel like i'm gonna go crazy. I'm scared. What is this? It it caused from my mind being idle and literally doing nothing but watching Netflix 20 hours a day? My panic attacks are ruthless because I don't feel like myself at all.",1
634," I was diagnosed with PTSD, STPD, and MDD when I was twenty two. I would like to go to community college by next year. What would be the best course for me?",1
635," I posted this in the Antidepressants sub but didn't hear anything back. So, it's still early so maybe I just need to push through. I'd been on 40mg of Citalopram for about 3 years when I went to the doctor because my anxiety was getting worse. She had me switch to Effexor XR the very next day. I've been on 75mg since and so far my anxiety is unchanged or worse and my depression is coming back hard. I'm feeling terrible about myself, overwhelmed by everything, and losing interest is basically everything I like to do. Normally I love to play video games for hours but now none of them are doing anything for me.",1
637," 2019 was quite simply, the worst year of my life. I was diagnosed with clinical depression late 2017, but the problems surmounted the past year. Came back home after graduating, thought things would finally change. But..bad breakup with the love of my life, unemployment and repeated repeated rejections, problems at home, had a ligament tear....it goes on and on. Wanted to start afresh the new decade, but it just plummeted lower and lower. Interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still haven't been gotten back to, so I think that's that- my last chance at some redemption is gone, im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment. Been shutting myself off everything, but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going. We were on the terrace smoking a fag, and at a time it was only me there. Then all the pent-up frustration let loose. All the failures had taken a toll, and I broke down. Went to the edge, said some words and was just ABOUT to jump when I saw s mething flash by me. A white trail of light. Wasn't a bird, or paper, or anything. My mind became even more blank but instead of jumping, I staggered back and fell back on the floor.",1
640," My Mental HELL began 2 months ago. I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone who died by suicide. Since then, my life changed completely. I don't know why. I don't know how. I don't know what to do next. I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing. I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.",1
641," I try my hardest to act like everything is good, but it's not. I'm lonely and miserable. I get angry BECAUSE I'm lonely and miserable. If I died today, I know deep down that I'd be forgotten within 2 months. Not a word about me. I know why, but it still hurts to know how invaluable I am to everyone. I try so hard to fit in. To make new friends. There's just so much about me that's unlikable and I know that it's not the depression talking. I've seen it for myself, in people's eyes and in their body signals. I want to live. But unemployment, depression, sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living. I can't even see death as an escape. There is no escape for this. I'm going to be a shell no matter what.",1
649,"so after months of being scared of getting a ""boy"" haircut, i finally showed my mom 3 types.. she picked out the one i wanted the least it's a undercut.. so hidden but i get the shorter hair.. and i had my first therapy session, which i was scared abt but i'm EXCITED to see her next week!!! now i just need to get my grades up!!",0
650," Does anyone else do this? I've self harmed in different ways throughout my life, as a kid I heard voices, had bizarre nonsensical paranoid beliefs and didn't know how to function in social situations, and I remember hitting myself in the head when I got stressed, or purposely pissing off my cat and then putting my hand near him and letting him tear it to shreds, or grinding my hand against a wall until it left marks. When I was 14 I began cutting, eventually began burning too, got a couple thousand scars as a result, I don't do it a ton anymore, but I've been punching walls daily for a while now, and I don't know why but it's just so satisfying. Getting pissed off and just being able to slam my fist into a wall, seeing the bruising, maybe even bleeding, it just feels good. I know I have potential to do real damage, and I've already accidentally knocked a tendon out of place doing it, but it just feels satisfying. Anyone else got experience with this?",1
