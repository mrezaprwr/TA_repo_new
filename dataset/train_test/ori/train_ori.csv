0,I had a really good day today!! Overcame a huge sadness that has been around for a few months and just had an amazing and happy day in for the first time in a while! Iâm really happy,0
1," Like most people here, I've experienced significant weight gain since starting Seroquel a few months ago, to the point where I'm considering changing meds. I've spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns I have surrounding it, but they seem to believe that it's not that bad, that I need to gain weight anyway so I might as well let it happen. While I do have a thin frame, that's a natural thing, putting on weight won't make me grow out, I'll just get a belly and it won't look good, not to mention be unhealthy, but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain. Is there anything I can do to change their mind, or at least have something to stop the weight gain? No matter how much I eat I'll put on weight, I went a few days without food and still put on weight, I'mnot sure how bad it's going to get and I really need something to help.",1
3,"I feel like my life is finally falling into place. Decent job, good grades in school and a lovely girlfriend. So happy I had to let out some steam in the restroom.",0
4," I was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars, all over both her wrists, both her forearms, upper arms, thighs, legs, ankles, stomach, just completely covered in them. This got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm, and I realised I'm that kid. I'm not completely covered in scars, but my ankles are scarred pretty badly, my arm, which is probably where most people look, is covered in cuts, scars and burns, I don't even hide it anymore because it's so hot (I'm talking like 42℃, where I physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out), and I'm that kid who people will stare at when he's walking to class, they might whisper to their friends about my arm, the teachers will see my arm and just assume that I'm just another emo, I don't even do anything in class because I'm so depressed that I just don't have the energy to work so I must just look like a massive poser. I'm always on the lookout for others with scars like mine, but there's nobody with them.",1
5,"After 4 years my hair is finally healed, & life is also getting much better. We find out if we get our house tomorrow, Iâve made leaps in the tattoo game, my kid starts kindergarten in the fall, we are expecting a new baby this spring too, and SO gets out of the military soon! It is FINALLY UPHILL!",0
8," I posted on here a little while ago when I experienced a traumatic event in which I was pinned down and choked by a student in the special education classroom I work in, and I suspected I had developed PTSD. I posted again after I was officially diagnosed with PTSD last Monday. The anxiety is still pretty overwhelming. I still can't work. They had to up my Ativan dosage and refer me to a psychiatrist because of concerns that I may be developing panic disorder. Everything is a mess because between worker's comp and my regular healthcare people, there are so many people involved who have to be kept updated and have to communicate amongst each other in order for things to run smoothly.",1
9,Hereâs a picture of grass smiling to brighten up your day!,0
12,This is my and my friend after almost a year of not seeing her. I surprised her for her birthday after setting up a surprise party and flying across the country.,0
13," It's hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm feeling really bad, it feels like my body is slightly vibrating. It only happens if I've been at a bad low for a really long time and I've been really inactive, probably laying in bed bc my body is aching so bad. Anyone else experience this, or am I alone in this?",1

16," I’ve mentioned it a couple times on here lately, but my depression has been ruining most parts of my life, including job performance. I’ve got a meeting in the morning with my bosses about my poor performance and I think I’ll be fired. Does anyone have any similar experiences? How did you handle it? How would you begin to explain to your boss the toll depression takes on you and your performance. My meeting is at 8am tomorrow morning and I’m desperate to talk to people with similar experiences. Thank you so much.",1
17,"After learning to read, he couldn't wait after his trip to the library!",0
19," Just curious if anyone has felt this or can relate to this. Long story short I lost my job at the start of they year (poor performances, disorganized, etc), second in a row. Finally went to the behavioral health place in town and was diagnosed with Major Depressive, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. Great. Ever since I was fired I’ve felt completely paralyzed on where to go from here. I have no college, no skills, nothing. I’ve worked two kinds of jobs, factories and offices. I could never keep up with the office jobs (see above), and factories make me MISERABLE. It’s nothing against that kind of work, it’s me. Overtime, overnights, the danger, everything about it for some reason made me so sad I couldn’t stand it.",1
20," I have diagnosed PTSD, depression and anxiety. I also have a severe chronic illness (Ulcerative Colitis) that effects my quality of life every single day. Most importantly before anything else, I am not in danger of harming myself. This past week I’ve been having disassociating episodes. I’m not sure if that’s even the right terminology. I had one 4 days ago that was the worst I ever experienced, I didn’t even feel comfortable enough driving since I was so out of it. Once I snapped out of that funk, I thought I was going to be ok. But since then I’ve had more and more issues with dissociation, including right now. I am so overwhelmed with depression and anxiety that I feel like I can’t physically move from my desk which is where I’ve been almost all day. I’m so overwhelmed that I couldn’t even watch Netflix. It’s like I’m having a depressed panic attack. I can’t snap out of it.",1
21,"My wife is out of town. I will be 70 in April. I made these Apple Chips all by myself. They are so hot that /r/FoodPorn blocked it for being too much for SFW. I also did the dishes, changed kitty litter and got and went through the mail. I am very happy I just wish I remember where I live!!! Jk.",0
22,"Just paid over HALF of my debt off today and realized how far Iâve come. I got my teeth straightened, lost 25 pounds, finally found affordable mental health treatment, and Iâm officially reenrolled back in school! For the first time in a long time, Iâm genuinely happy.",0

26," A few weeks ago I was on a train. Some guy got on about an hour into the ride of three hours with his girlfriend. They sat down and she was being quite loud so I looked over for a second instinctively and he shouted at me. I just ignored him and went back to my music. Over the next half hour, however, I heard him muttering to his girlfriend about me. They were sitting maybe 5 seats in front of me, so I couldn't hear too well. He got up after a while to, I'd assume, use the toilet, and when he walked past me he was glaring at me and even leered at me. I was quite afraid that he would be getting off at my stop and I wasn't sure what to do so I held onto my bag securely and started going over all the scenarios in my head that could happen, what he wanted and everything like that.",1
27,"This is me on a Friday feeling super happy. No special reason. It's very rare I post a pic of myself. I hate pics of myself. Anyway, happy Friday! ð",0
28,Happy young man today. Finally getting my car into the shop. Someone keyed it up. Also Iâm more than 5 months sober and Iâm keeping it this way. I wasted to many years I can hardly even recall to addictions. Iâm happier this way.,0
32," Ever since developing PTSD, I've found that the list of movies and TV shows I can't watch just gets longer and longer. I've never been into horror or anything anyways, but I did used to watch some fairly intense and suspenseful shows, and I can't do that anymore, at least right now.",1
33, People with mental disorder what are the side-effects of your disorder? Physiological or psycological?,1
34," I need to sleep. I can't function enough to do anything else and I need to sleep it off. But I'm so upset that it's making my insides twist and turn and I want to scream, so it's hard for me to fall asleep.",1

37, It is so hard to get up some days but I'm pretty sure my parents think I'm just making excuses to be home. I try to go if I can but some days I just can't. They don't understand...,1
38," I’ve been going through stuff a normal teen like me shouldn’t be going through. I live in a small house with one little sister and my parents. I also live with my nieces and nephews. I must admit I have a great life. Honestly I have clothes, food, a roof, a loving family, a boyfriend that loves me and amazing friends but of course I’m selfish so I can’t see that because it’s too little. I guess it’s like why is she saying goodbye nothing is wrong,, well there is...My sister is in jail and expects me to do everything and that means I go to court, I support her two kids so I’m basically a mom at the moment as well as sending her care packages and placing money on her books. The reason I do that is because my mom is dealing with too much. We have financial issues as well as too many kids to support. We barely get enough food and go shopping for clothes. ",1
40," I'm not a fan of self diagnosis, and I'm currently seeing a therapist and have been professionally diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past, but I know that there's something else wrong with me. I have so many weird issues that can't be explained by depression and anxiety, like sometimes feeling like I'm not real or like I'm in a dream or something, and my fight or flight response it literally just freeze or accept what's about to happen and brace for it mentally. I've gone through trauma in the past that caused me to have intense flashbacks and I've undergone EMDR treatment. Sometimes I feel really paranoid and disconnected from reality. ",1
45," I got married in July, and was very excited. In the post-calm and happiness of the wedding, I started to experience my first nightmares and flashbacks and my life was finally stable enough for my mind and body to cope with my trauma. So here is what is happening to the heart for a PTSD survivor!",1

50," So I'm a male, I'm 16, and I was thinking today (bad idea, I know), I was thinking about the previous school I was at, and I remembered something quite traumatic that happened to me in year 9, when I was 14. I'm not sure how I didn't remember this until now, but it's possible that my brain forced me to forget it. Okay, so, in year 9 I had really terrible anxiety and that made me an easy bullying target, and I was bullied very badly, but one kid in particular went a bit overboard. I sat next to this kid, I'll call him Angus. I sat next to Angus in history due to our seating arrangement, and every lesson he would make sexual actions towards me. It started off mild, like he'd just say quietly that he wanted to kiss me or sleep with me, creepy shit like that, but then it got worse. He began to touch me. Quite inappropriately.",1
51,This dog at my school for Feel Good Friday,0
52," I feel horrible, I can't feel my legs and I just feel really angry and anxious and like there's a bee hive in my chest. I already took my meds but it hasn't done anything",1
53," So, I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a severe generalized anxiety disorder, but I've been having some symptoms over the last year and a half that don't seem to fit into those categories. I've been experiencing a very extreme fluctuating mood, I can go from feeling extremely elated and invincible, having so many thoughts and ideas running through my head, talking very fast, having extreme amounts of energy, and feeling oddly irritated with people, to feeling horribly depressed and empty. I'm extremely impulsive, which has lead to me basically covering my body in self harm cuts and scars in less than a year, along with just randomly tying a noose up and hanging myself, not even necessarily because I really want to be dead, but just to see if I will die this time.",1
57, I literally dread going back to school after every weekend. I hate it so fucking much. I stay home a lot and my grades are suffering quite badly. How can I make school not as bad? I am a high school sophomore btw,1
58,Found this under a house we were remodeling,0
59," I took an IQ some months ago and results were that I have a slow processing speed and working memory. Prior to that I was diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt. In the hospital I was really relieved to learn that the problems I was so sick and tired of was due to depression and anxiety stealing resources from important parts of the brain. So, ever since, I've been hoping that my ""stupidness"" problems that are caused by depression will eventually go away but I've been on antidepressants and therapy for months. The main doctor there said I would feel the full effects of my antidepressent Welbutrin after a month, but it's been 7 months now and I'm honestly no different than before. I'm better than I have been out of the hospital and prior to the suicide attempt, but I'm exactly where I was 365 days ago. ",1

WHY DONT PEOPLE TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY?!? I’m crying really bad right now because someone just did this to me after I told them nicely if they could stop..",1
64," I'm overwhelmed, having constant panic attacks. I just want to be asleep where I can't feel anything. I slept until 6pm. I haven't eaten in over 12 hours. I have no desire too. I'm drinking water. I have no energy to go downstairs and talk to anyone. I don't want anyone to bother me in my room. I'm not fighting it this time. It's gonna take over and i'm gonna let it. I'm just gonna lay here in bed on Netflix and playing games on my phone until it's time to take my sleeping pills again and sleep all day. Then dread to wake up and do it again. I'm tired of trying. My soul is tired.",1

84," Everything I used to enjoy has become worthless, it all feels like a chore rather than a relaxing hobby, nothing holds meaning, nothing feels exciting, everything feels dull and pointless, I've tried everything to improve this, but it doesn't work.

87,Just me and my girlfriend having the last dance of the night.,0
88," When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in. I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing.",1

94,"Despite the shit show that our âdemocracyâ has become, the awful words and behaviors of our current and past representatives, and the âRussicaficationâ that was attempted/happened during the election

I see a bright future ahead. Especially if Bernie sticks to his guns and doesnât back down out of fear. 

I feel like America as a whole is slowly starting to be aware of the fact that weâre a first world country without universal healthcare. And insane education prices. The capitalistic nature of the economy. And how no one cares for the benefit of the lower class. 

Something in my gut is telling me everything regarding our future will turn out A-ok. Whoâs with me..?",0

96," I can't even get an appointment to be evaluated for anti-depressants for 2 weeks.

Im sorry) But when I planned mine, I did it with out thinking clearly. I was blinded by the pain and sadness that I was feeling. At that time I was having a panic attack that wasn’t going away , i was shaking sweating , and crying uncontrollably for 5 hours straight.

102," I’ve always had depression, and it’s gotten really bad this year. It’s affecting every aspect of my life, I’ve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess I’d made of my work.

107," You'll never get used to being unloved or unwanted. You'll never get used to the pain and suffering of being left out of fun events, group outings or friend/family moments. It always hurts and the heart break from each and every time it happens will only get worse as you start to realize just how unloved and unwanted you really are. This will turn to anger and the more you suppress it, the worse it gets. When you finally burst open and let all that anger out, they'll use it as the perfect excuse as to why they don't want you there.",1
111," So a very basic rundown of my mental illness history: I'm a 15 year old male who has had anxiety issues my whole life, but morphed into severe social anxiety disorder 4 years ago. I have had major depressive disorder for 4 years, and I was recently told by my psychologist that I appear to be a ""self-aware borderline"". I have struggled with pretty severe self harm for about a year now, and I have covered myself in scars. I've made a couple of suicide attempts due to all of this, and I've noticed that recently (maybe over the past 9 months) I've been extremely short tempered and will get very angry at people for the slightest things, especially my parents. I've told them that I can't control the anger multiple times, but they keep just believing that I'm using that as an excuse to be an asshole. Truth is, I really cannot control myself when I'm in this angry state",1

I’ve gain a lot of it back now but a few days ago I tried vomiting what I ate. I just feel like what I put into my body is the only sense of control that I have left.

141," I fucking despise when people say this, or when they rattle off ""good sleep, good exercise and a balanced diet is all you need"" because it is total bullshit. I went out for a few days recently, just me and a couple mates, I felt like absolute shit the entire time, despite getting a good 9 hours of sleep, eating well and getting out a lot. In fact, when I got home I cut myself that night and actually came quite close to an overdose the next morning.

143," This is a big problem I’ve trying to understand this past year and it’s about how anxiety affects my brain chemistry. Today I was practice driving with my mom and suddenly dozed off into some kind of sleep/dream for a few seconds and nearly crashed the car into a sidewalk at probably 40mph. Luckily no ones hurt and the car isn’t damaged. I’m so pissed though because I know for sure I slept 8 hours last night and the night before. My sleep schedule app is averaging 7hrs 52 mins.

I indicated him to pass on which he responded with a waving gesture for me to drive out first. But because I was in a good mood, I wanted him to pass first. So was he.

We ended up throwing gestures at each other so the other one will finally pass.

Once I'd finished I tucked my lighter back into my pocket, sat there for a bit and after 20 seconds or so I started to slam my fist into my leg repeatedly out of frustration and he properly sat up, once i stopped he continued to give me this really sad look, I was sitting there for a few more minutes but he kept looking at me instead of going back to sleep, which isn't something he ever does. I tried to pat him until he would lie down again but he wouldn't, I eventually got up and walked off but he kept looking at me the whole time with the same sad eyes.",1

It’s not normal crying, and he can turn it off and on like a switch. So several days during the week he will come in and “turn on” this wail. The kid “turns off” the wail as soon as his mom complies with what he wants. He is extremely manipulative. The wailing though. It brings me right back to the abuse. The wailing sounds exactly like myself and my siblings when we were suffering the abuse. Yesterday, he was in the office just screaming and wailing, and we had to have 6 police officers come in and try to manage it before he was taken to a hospital. It caused a panic attack. ",1
325," The ward is a couple of hours away, so it'll be a long drive. I'm kind of excited in a weird way, I might finally be in the hands of people who can help me. I was recently diagnosed with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, which was a bit surprising, I always thought I just had depression/anxiety, but I guess this explains those periods of time where I am extremely energetic to the point where I begin being extremely impulsive and basically idiotic. My cutting will finally be put under control, no more covering myself in scars to purposely ruin my body. At least, no more of that for a few weeks. It'll be an interesting experience.

I had some intense medical issues (on top of my mental issues), I missed one appointment and I never went back. The psychiatrist was phenomenal and genuinely cared about my well being.

For years I correlated being in a relationship with having no autonomy over myself, my thoughts, needs, and feelings don't matter, and that I am completely powerless. But yesterday I realized that I have these beliefs because my brain had equated the abuse I faced as a child, to what being in a relationship will be like. As a kid, I remember having this deep feeling of dread at the thought of ever being in a relationship because I thought any kind of romantic relationship in the future would just mean a continuation of what was happening to me at the time, and meant that I'd lose ownership over myself again and be completely powerless.",1

But the last few weeks I've been struggling. It's super frustrating because things are actually going pretty well for me right now.

I've noticed that I always like to show that I have a clean arm, I'll gesture with it all the time, if I'm sitting down I'll lie it on the table so that people can see that is is unscarred, I just use it all the time. I don't really hide my scars unless it's cold enough to do so, so it's kind of obvious my left arm is scarred up anyway. Does anybody else do this if they have a clean arm?",1

When I was young I wasn't dealing with the bullying, I thought it was normal because it was something that had always been happening but when it got really bad in year 6 I told my parents eventually because I realised I couldn't go on with it. Year 7 it began again, and then stopped, then it returned yet again in year 9, but when I got to year 10 I began realising how to deal with it. I have developed many extremely severe mental illnesses from lots of trauma I've experienced and this leads to lots of self hatred and lack of self worth, and I used this to my advantage. When I was called faggot, fuckup, fatass gorilla, anorexic, cutter, emo, any of it, I would laugh and fully agree, and even start giving them ideas for insults to give me.

429, I have been playing football since 7th grade and I would say I have wanted to quit since the beginning of 9th. I already thought it wasn't worth all the time you put in but now with depression I have no desire what so ever. A big problem here is my coaches really like me and I dread having to deal with them and also more importantly my dad is an 8th grade FB coach and would HATE if I were to quit. I just really don't enjoy it at all anymore and it makes getting up for school even harder when we're in season. That's the other thing like we're not even in season I try to pride myself on not quitting in the middle of things so it shouldn't be as big of a deal to him. I don't know just thinking about it makes me more depressed... I am a sophomore right now and I don't think I can take 2 more years of football,1

I try to say that my new computer will come tomorrow or that it is irrational etc. But it doesn't help, it feels like I am really feeling this way and it is 199% me. Also urges. Like I noticed the power socket, and then I felt sn urge to go and do it which kept repeating, like the pointless feeling was pushing me.

They're definitely not as bad as they were when I was unmediated but they still bother me regularly, and it made me wonder if this is normal or if my medication should be blocking them more than it is.

544," Hey guys. So I don't post here often, but I suffer from ADHD, depression and anxiety. So long story short, I was diagnosed around October although I should have been diagnosed a long while ago. So the first thing I went in for was ADHD. It took me this long to go in for this (I'm a sophomore in high school) mainly because although I couldn't pay attention I was smart enough to do well if that makes sense. And the main reason I actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers. But as I got older, starting around middle school, the material was getting harder so I had to pay attention to do as well as I normally did. And then I hit my lowest lows in high school, particularly this year. ",1

I’m nervous about trying Klonopin because I don’t know anything about it really. I’ve only been on Xanax throughout the years. Is there any major difference? Doubling the dose of Seroquel doesn’t make me too nervous but something about the switch to Klonopin does. Any advice is appreciated!",1
