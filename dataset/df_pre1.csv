1,like most people here i have experienced significant weight gain since starting seroquel a few months ago to the point where i am considering changing meds i have spoken to a couple of my doctors about this and the concerns i have surrounding it but they seem to believe that it is not that bad that i need to gain weight anyway so i might as well let it happen while i do have a thin frame that is a natural thing putting on weight will not make me grow out i will just get a belly and it will not look good not to mention be unhealthy but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain is there anything i can do to change their mind or at least have something to stop the weight gain no matter how much i eat i will put on weight i went a few days without food and still put on weight imnot sure how bad it is going to get and i really need something to help,1

4,i was talking to one of my friends the other week and he mentioned a girl in his year at his school who is just covered with self harm scars all over both her wrists both her forearms upper arms thighs legs ankles stomach just completely covered in them this got me thinking that every school statistically will have at least one kid covered in self harm and i realised i am that kid i am not completely covered in scars but my ankles are scarred pretty badly my arm which is probably where most people look is covered in cuts scars and burns i do not even hide it anymore because it is so hot i am talking like where i physically cannot wear long sleeves without passing out and i am that kid who people will stare at when he is walking to class they might whisper to their friends about my arm the teachers will see my arm and just assume that i am just another emo i do not even do anything in class because i am so depressed that i just do not have the energy to work so i must just look like a massive poser i am always on the lookout for others with scars like mine but there is nobody with them,1

110,hello everyone i have had anxiety problems as far back as years old i am now and a couple months ago in addition to wellbutrin prescribed month before this for my depression i was prescribed remeron to help with anxiety after a weeks or two i started missing doses and had my first panic attack which was just awful for the first few minutes it felt like a heart burn which i used to get so i did not think about it i started rubbing my chest to alleviate the feeling then out of no where the attack came and felt like someone grabbed my heart and squeezed it this was then followed my the feeling of my heart pouring out blood and then then tension in the heartchest area and dizziness for the rest of the day,1
111,so a very basic rundown of my mental illness history i am a year old male who has had anxiety issues my whole life but morphed into severe social anxiety disorder years ago i have had major depressive disorder for years and i was recently told by my psychologist that i appear to be a selfaware borderline i have struggled with pretty severe self harm for about a year now and i have covered myself in scars i have made a couple of suicide attempts due to all of this and i have noticed that recently maybe over the past months i have been extremely short tempered and will get very angry at people for the slightest things especially my parents i have told them that i can not control the anger multiple times but they keep just believing that i am using that as an excuse to be an asshole truth is i really cannot control myself when i am in this angry state,1
112,couldnt be more excited im in the second year and final semester of my masters program and today we had our comprehensive exams which dictates if we receive our degrees or not i killed that test today and i will be walking in april im first gen too and got the degree on a full ride,0
113,ive literally never posted on my cake day before im pretty excited also my husband likes to make me coffee and pick out a mug for me that he thinks matches the mood i am in he has not been wrong yet and entirely unprompted he will walk me from my car to the house with an umbrella so i dont get my library books wet and he fixes my car and our fridge and kisses me on the nose life can be shitty but with him its like my broken pieces are put back together,0
114,exciting day went to the livestock auction and bought few ewe and lambs when we got home we found this extra bonus we named her phoebe mama and baby are fine,0
115,i then get worried that the anxiety will prevent me from ever being hungry again then i will get malnourished and then my organs will shut down it sucks,1
116,am the only one allowed to wear a cap at work it is a special treatment ,0
117,my boyfriend and i have been together since but my parents didnt approve and prohibited my relationship with him because they thought that my depression stemmed from him since he was depressed too my parents believed that he was affecting me and it was all his doing but of course him and i kept in touch and saw each other pretty often but behind my parents back i got diagnosed with hypothyroidism on i got treatment and my depression faded away and now that my depression is back starting and already got checked out on my thyroid everythings completely fine i dont know why im feeling low again,1
118,all these stories saying i was extremely depressed as a teen but i got better and eventually graduated with a degree in every subject known to man just feel so unrealistic i mean they could happen sometimes but where are all the stories saying i was extremely depressed as a teen i dropped out of school at and now years later i am still living with my parents without any sort of proper education beyond year covered in self inflicted scars dealing with organ failure due to my drug abuse and and struggling to eat from years of bulimia but hey i am still alive that just sounds so much more realistic and it could help those people who are in that position where they can not go to school anymore they are struggling to get out of bed and they do not know what to do,1

141,i fucking despise when people say this or when they rattle off good sleep good exercise and a balanced diet is all you need because it is total bullshit i went out for a few days recently just me and a couple mates i felt like absolute shit the entire time despite getting a good hours of sleep eating well and getting out a lot in fact when i got home i cut myself that night and actually came quite close to an overdose the next morning despite this i just know people will still babble on that i am just not trying hard enough and that exercise will be my saviour despite me being severely depressed while doing soccer and tennis weekly and also working as a referee a couple years ago,1

161,my therapist suddenly left i have no idea why but had to change therapists the problem is the new therapist does not seem to have read my notes i know she can not know everything i talked about but she seemed to not know anything i know my old therapist made notes so im assuming she shouldve read them she also does not seem to add a lot to the conversation there a lot of awkward silences where my old therapist would key in on something bothering me and press me further does anyone have experience with this should i give it a week or just ask to change therapists now,1
162,hi i was attacked by an intruder to my home a few months ago my therapist diagnosed me with moderate ptsd my landlords matience man is very bad about knocking and announcing himself when he comes over she notifies us a week ahead of time but with huge windows on when he can stop by for example he will be over mondaythursday if we arent home he opens the rental with the key the problem is he knocks on the back door once our back door has an entryway therefore you cannot hear a knock anywhere in the house from that door,1
163,i often feel like all the parts of my life are very confusing i often get a distorted sense of time i will think it is pm at midnight for example and i often find my sense of reality to be very odd i struggle to know whether or not anything is real and if it is everything seems to blend together into one big slab of time where i am not there like i am watching it happen from somewhere else watching time speed by before my eyes i also tend to have very confused thoughts i will be speaking then suddenly forget what i was saying or even the topic of conversation or who i am talking to or i will just randomly say stuff that makes no sense and i do not know why,1
164,my wonderful goofball of a boyfriend he definitely makes me very happy ,0
165,i do not want to see the bad in the world again i do not want to shroud myself in it but by the way it looks it is heading that way i am tired of the toxic behavior that is being constantly thrown at me both online and off i am tired of being pressured to hold everyone together i am tired of being held to expectations that i am having trouble to complete,1
166,this happened to me last week i was about to drive out of our driveway with the car when suddenly a guy on a bike appeared on my left he wanted to cross the sidewalk in front of me i indicated him to pass on which he responded with a waving gesture for me to drive out first but because i was in a good mood i wanted him to pass first so was he we ended up throwing gestures at each other so the other one will finally pass in the end he passed our driveway and because i was driving in the same direction as him i waved him goodbye and i drove past him and he laughed and waved back just a wholesome little story,0
167,i have held a schizophrenia diagnosis for over a year now with my first psychosis being diagnosed almost years ago since then the people who know namely my family expect me to function exactly the same as if i was healthy even if i am in the middle of an extremely intense episode now a week ago i injured my knee my kneecap dislodged basically dislocated out of the blue quickly popped back in went to see my gp the next day and it happened again i am on crutches now since i can not walk on it and i am getting scans done it is likely that the recovery period will be a number of months with surgery playing a part since then everyone seems to be much more worried nobody expects me to be up and out of the house constantly nobody expects me to be fully functional and operating perfectly normally even though this knee is bothering me much less than my schizophrenia does on any given day and any psychotic episode is miles worse than not being able to walk and it is really quite depressing how little people care about anything mental health related,1
168,i want to be the prettiest girl my boyfriends ever had i want to be the favorite sibling i want to be the best at my job i want to be the funniest friend i guess it is bc criticism bothers me so much and i never feel good enough deep down it is so exhausting and i know i can never be perfect but i feel this pressure all the time that i have to be good in others eyes and i need praise so i can feel good about myself,1

173,how intertwined are these two conditions i am under the impression that low self esteem fuels depression but i want to know the specifics of how they affect each other my low self esteem makes up my entire personality and affects every waking thought and decision,1
174,i always take notes when i feel like shit and i have been feeling worse since i started going to an outpatient program i do not really know what to do with all this i guess if someone could help point me in the direction of what it is thats wrong with me or if you have gone through something similar your advice would be greatly appreciated,1

188,this feels like it should be super trivial but im super appreciative to my principal for understanding my position of wanting to get back into teaching in my original subject but not being able to teach that here i used to teach music but life happened and i ended up an elementary tutor so shes allowing me to go to the big music convention next month on school time sucked so having something go right was something i desperately needed have an amazing day reddit,0
189,first she dropped me from once a week to once every other week without letting me know beforehand so i had to deal with that now shes cancelling my appointments leaving me for weeks without therapy causing large gaps in my mental health treatment i feel like i cant get better this way my depression is getting bad again and its frustrating to look forward to relief from a therapy appointment only for it to be cancelled,1

207,for me personally my brother is i am and for a while i was not sure if he knew about my depression or anxiety or psychosis or bipolar or anything and he probably thought that our cats really hated me for a while but recently i went to hospital for three weeks and my parents probably told him why my parents are horrible at not telling people about my issues he is fairly absent minded and generally gets easily distracted and i would not be surprised if he did not know what self harm is but i have got scars all over and i have no idea what he thinks happened,1
208,i used to be really happy when i was a kid i was even happy as a teenager but now i feel like no matter what i do i just cant be happy,1

210,after a week off work with tonsillitis and a stressy week at work while recovering i am finally healthy enough to start knitting again,0
211,after having read about it i am just so disappointed that it is not acknowledged in the dsm for being too similar to ptsd even though from what i read complex ptsd occurs after years of repeated trauma typically during childhood and has a much more profound impact than experiencing one traumatic event and getting ptsd from that because you developed while surrounded by trauma and cptsd is even acknowledged by the va as a real disorder and i am just confused as to if it is ever going to be acknowledged or not,1
212,so i went to the doctor the other day for anxiety and depression she switched me from celexa to effexor xr as well as referring me to a psychiatrist counselor not sure i do not know if it is the switching meds or what but my depression is getting way worse my only experience with this kind of thing was in high school now i was a depressed kid and my dad insisted on a christian counselor the first session i actually opened up and then he invited my dad in and told him everything i would said with me in the room it was humiliating and really his only advice was to pray more i am not against religion at all but that probably was not the kind of help i needed,1
213,anyone else feel this way i personally am not always sad i would not say i am happy but i am just merely existing i am sad at times but not always i would more describe depression as feeling empty and meaningless and sadness is a symptom thoughts,1
214,insurance stopped covering my therapy so i can no longer wax poetic about why i hate driving or how much i hate interacting with strangers nope cant do that anymore as every session needs to be focused on the biggest part of my trauma the real meat which is the fact that i absolutely hate myself and hate myself for being abused i am literally disgusted by myself my female body parts they make me want to gag i feel like a child again being forced into sexuality again i dont know that ill ever feel like a woman and i get grossed out thinking about sex and body parts,1

225,i am not suicidal but i think about dying a lot and i do think about killing myself not seriously over the smallest things for example today i spilled something and i just thought to myself i could just end it so i do not have to deal with it or if i do not want to do something i am the same way anyone else like this,1

255,i have really spotty memory but for some reason i can always reexperience how i felt during a certain time period or event even if i cant remember anything else about it it is like i only have memories in the form of the emotions i felt during it and the emotional responses i have to the things i try to remember a lot of the time i am left having to piece everything back together around my emotional memory just to get a sense of what actually happened,1

261,my brother and his fianc have announced that they are expecting i am so excited,0
262,i do not hide my arm my scars there range from month to just over a year old the scars are pretty noticeable but i am not attention seeking by not hiding them i simply can not deal with the heat and the uncomfortable feeling of wearing long sleeves while everyone else is comfortably wearing short sleeves and getting people telling me to take my jumper off like they did back when i hid my scars like the plague i have scars on my ankles my thigh my shoulder and my hip as well and i hide my ankle scars and the shoulder thigh and hip scars are hidden easily by my clothes since i am male but i only hide my ankles because they have fresher marks on them when they are older i will not hide them the ones on my thigh are very extreme there are an insane amount of scars and some are quite deep and i refuse to let anyone get a glimpse of my thigh just because the scarring is so severe but my arm which is only moderately scarred i will not hide it is australia it gets extremely hot wearing long sleeves is actually risking my health because of how hot it is so no i am not attention seeking i am just choosing to not give a shit,1

268,just carved decay into my lower thigh near my calf pretty deep and afterwards i just thought yeah thatll be there literally forever whatever who cares then i proceeded to accidentally lightly cut my left thigh the thigh i literally never use for self harm aside from one scar that i do not remember making so i was probably dissociated and i am still feeling real shit about it the cut is minor but it is just enough to know that it will leave a faint scar and i am mad pissed forget my bloody carved up other leg with a fucking word on it that will be there until my fucking body well decays,1
269,this is going to be triggering so please leave now if graphic detail of self harm upsets you now i cut myself or so times on my thigh around an hour ago they were not deep but also were not shallow probably all around the dermis somewhere maybe a couple grazing the top of fat tissue i let them bleed for a long while before cleaning up but i realised i suddenly felt very dizzy it is been getting worse and worse i feel nauseous and fatigued as well i am assuming they are blood loss related as i was not having any of these symptoms before i created the wounds they did bleed a pretty significant amount should i be worried i feel like i am going to just pass out soon,1
270,recently i told my friend that i have decided to go clean from self harm for a bit making it very clear that i will almost definitely relapse at some point now this friend also suffers from self injury and has schizophrenia after telling her this she was happy that i had decided to go clean again but today she messaged me saying that if i cut again she will commit suicide i am fucking terrified she is attempted suicide multiple times before and i have talked her out of it a few times as well but i know i will relapse again and i am terrified because she is threatening her life if i do i am so scared i do not know what to do i do not want to lose her but i also know that i will cut at some point in the future and it will be my fault that she is dead if she follows through with what she said does anyone know what i can do,1
271,whenever i appear around her she suddenly has to leave and does so within minutes of me being there it is been happening since our last long talk that talk was over a month ago and i thought she would be over what i said by now in my opinion it really was not that bad and any feelings i have towards her have been buried deep because she is now in a relationship the relationship does not bother me at all but i feel like what i said to her did and i am completely confused because she asked me to say it however i feel like a complete moron for doing so and i regret it more than i have regretted any other move i have made by mistaking deep friendship for love,1
272,i am kinda in a mood to tell this story and feel free to put your first cutting deep incident in the comments my first time was in june last year i was cutting a lot at the time although i did not even find it an issue it was just something i did i was cutting my shoulder a lot at the time and i got home from school went into my room grabbed my blade and got to work now this was a blade from a shaving razor i had taken apart it was the sharpest blade in the razor i did not know this at the time so i put the blade to my shoulder and cut i immediately panicked the cut was gaping open and i could see a bit of weird yellow bubbly stuff in it which i later learnt was fat the cut was bleeding a ton so i was trying to stop the bleeding with about a million tissues i knew i needed stitches but i was not about to tell anyone what i had done after about half an hour my mum came into my room to remind me that i had a tutoring lesson and we had to leave i freaked the fuck out my shoulder was still gaping open although the bleeding had slowed down,1

319,so basically it all started after reading about chester benningtons suicide about months ago then i started having intrusive thoughts about it then i googled it started reading about depression then i had a major panic attack to the point of vomittingyes i know this is a typical trigger for ocd and this is how it usually starts i had ocd episode years ago but can not remember exactly if it was the same anyway here is what happens,1
320,me and my girlfriend have been together almost months now and honestly just having her in my life makes everything times easier even when shes annoying the s outta me i cant help but love that girl to pieces im going to marry her not that she knows i think this for sure but shes the girl i want to spend the rest of my life with and personally that makes me happy ,0
321,so i am sitting at the kitchen table and my best friend is sitting across from me and my mind starts spinning i have a delusion that my friends and family are going to be killed by someone and replaced with look a likes so i start believing they took her too so her defense of course was that she was the real her but in my head i just knew the fake her would say something like that so to prove that she was her she decided to play footise with me it worked,1
322,one of my friends lost his brother to suicide years ago and has still not completely dealt withgotten over i hate using that term with reference to someonesomething that has died it my depression has become significantly increased in the last months or so and my friend has noticed this he told me one day with as serious of a look on his face and tone in his voice that i have ever seen that if i ever try to kill myself and he finds out about it he will cut me out of his life for good completely cut off communication with me never want to see me again,1
323,ive been told by close friends and family that i tend to disassociate but im not really sure if i do or not ive never been told any of this by a psychologist or anyone certified to diagnose also i dont think that ive been in a traumatic event i was in an very toxic romantic relationship not so long ago but it never got to physical abuse it was really emotionally draining and hurtful though,1
324,so i work at a jr high school we have one incredibly emotionally unstable student he will come in to the counseling office where i work as the nurse and just wail its not normal crying and he can turn it off and on like a switch so several days during the week he will come in and turn on this wail the kid turns off the wail as soon as his mom complies with what he wants he is extremely manipulative the wailing though it brings me right back to the abuse the wailing sounds exactly like myself and my siblings when we were suffering the abuse yesterday he was in the office just screaming and wailing and we had to have police officers come in and try to manage it before he was taken to a hospital it caused a panic attack,1
325,the ward is a couple of hours away so it will be a long drive i am kind of excited in a weird way i might finally be in the hands of people who can help me i was recently diagnosed with rapidcycling bipolar disorder which was a bit surprising i always thought i just had depressionanxiety but i guess this explains those periods of time where i am extremely energetic to the point where i begin being extremely impulsive and basically idiotic my cutting will finally be put under control no more covering myself in scars to purposely ruin my body at least no more of that for a few weeks it will be an interesting experience it will fuck with my schooling a fair bit but my mental illnesses already fucked over my education enough anyway and this might be a start to my recovery,1
326,this is shuga shuga likes to sleep shuga is an old but good kitty,0

362,i have this weird habit of staring at my inner forearm in public and at home the scars there are probably about months to just over a year old and i kind of like the way they look which is probably weird but especially for me because whenever i look at the scars on my outer forearm i hate them for being so visible and still so red after six months of healing but the scars on my inner forearm almost satisfy me they are not even very deep at all nothing compared to my thigh but i like staring at them anyway,1

366,a lot of my fear of intimacy and relationships comes from my trauma warped perception that relationships are supposed to mirror my abuse as a child for years i correlated being in a relationship with having no autonomy over myself my thoughts needs and feelings do not matter and that i am completely powerless but yesterday i realized that i have these beliefs because my brain had equated the abuse i faced as a child to what being in a relationship will be like as a kid i remember having this deep feeling of dread at the thought of ever being in a relationship because i thought any kind of romantic relationship in the future would just mean a continuation of what was happening to me at the time and meant that i would lose ownership over myself again and be completely powerless,1

413,most of my scars are on my thigh but i cut my left arm a fair bit too enough to have it scarred up quite badly and although i have scars on my right arm too they are so close to being invisible and there is barely any of them so my arm is basically clean i have noticed that i always like to show that i have a clean arm i will gesture with it all the time if i am sitting down i will lie it on the table so that people can see that is is unscarred i just use it all the time i do not really hide my scars unless it is cold enough to do so so it is kind of obvious my left arm is scarred up anyway does anybody else do this if they have a clean arm,1
414,but people usually are not like that right i think it would be so reassuring if someone loved me that much especially my fp i do not even know what my fp truly thinks of me since he is not as open about his feelings,1

422,i have been through a lot of bullying since kindergarten until last year i am in year now when i was young i was not dealing with the bullying i thought it was normal because it was something that had always been happening but when it got really bad in year i told my parents eventually because i realised i could not go on with it year it began again and then stopped then it returned yet again in year but when i got to year i began realising how to deal with it i have developed many extremely severe mental illnesses from lots of trauma i have experienced and this leads to lots of self hatred and lack of self worth and i used this to my advantage when i was called faggot fuckup fatass gorilla anorexic cutter emo any of it i would laugh and fully agree and even start giving them ideas for insults to give me this threw them back a lot but the physical side of it was still an issue,1

462,my daily routine lately that has worked wonders also been repeating this mantra as i have severe anxiety dont worry about all of those what ifs things arent a problem until theyre a problem the anxieties over what you might have done wrong or might do wrong or not actual problems that exist yet if they become a problem youll handle and solve them its okay youre all good and youre capable of whatever life throws at you,0
463,i was talking to my psychologist about some fairly annoying hallucinations i have been having a ton of recently mostly stuff like constantly hearing a tv or a radio seeing people coming towards me when i am on a walk but then vanishing when they get close or hearing someone walking around my house chatting away and she seemed pretty bothered that my medication is not stopping them as much as it should they are definitely not as bad as they were when i was unmediated but they still bother me regularly and it made me wonder if this is normal or if my medication should be blocking them more than it is what kind of hallucinations do you all have on medication should i look into changing my meds up or is this normal,1
464,i recently watched black panther and there is a character in that who scars himself for every person he kills this got me thinking about how self harm is shown in movies or tv this guy seemed to just do it as a ritualistic thing although there is a batman villain who cuts himself every time he kills someone and he reveals that he got into it because of the rush it gave him a couple of the main characters from the first ahs season cut one of the main characters from orphan black cuts herself on her back and she is often seen as the more insane character and all this made me realise that self harm is often seen as a very dramatic extreme even insane behaviour,1

476,i have completely exhausted my options i have completely exhausted my will to promote myself and with little to no success i do not expect the people in my life to buy my art but after hearing them go on about how much they like it i figured they would want to at least support me with social media follows hear me out i am not sad because i am not getting likes but sad because the people who seem like they are wanting to support me are not,1

478,ive been sitting on my couch playing video games and sleeping all day for about hours i havent showered have been eating excessively and have only gotten up a couple of times to go to the bathroom i am disgusted with myself the reason im doing this is because i want to distract myself eating sleeping and playing games ive been having intense urges to cut all week and im home alone today i absolutely hate myself i just wanted to get this out of my chest somewhere and somehow,1

480,so i have been thinking a lot about my self harming recently i am days clean atm so of course i spend every second wanting to relapse and i have noticed that i was never too aware of why i was cutting as badly as i was i think that the reason i have done it so much in such a short space of time is that i get kind of curious to see how far i can go if that makes sense i sort of can not even feel the pain anymore i just do it out of curiosity if that makes sense i would sort of spread it out around my body and i got really curious to see how much i could take i am fascinated by how easy it is for me to fuck my body up for life and now i am starting to realise that i was seeing how far i could go how much i could cover myself in scars does anybody else get me or has anyone else felt the same way,1

487,i have reached a point where i have once again given up on life i constantly feel like it is not worth it to continue playing this charade of incessant let downs and i am tired of fighting to build a life amid the slings and arrows of being a trans woman just to see it all fall apart each and every time i feel like i am completely and utterly alone in this world my family and a large majority of my childhood friends have abandoned me my daughter refuses to acknowledge my existence and has fully blocked any contact from me and any friends i seem to make are either narcissists who are just out to take advantage of my depression or are friends until i am the one that needs the help i am so tired of living this way what is wrong with me that i can not even have a single friend that genuinely cares about me i feel like dying i just want the hurting to stop,1

489,in his videos about self injury not only does he almost completely ignore all forms of self harm except for cutting but he generalises all self harmers to be attention seekers constantly stating that its only white privileged upper class girls who cut which shames those people who self harm who fit that description and makes people like me who do not fit that description feel alienated and fake he calls self harmers morons crazy psychopaths idiots fuckups and says that people with real problems do not self harm using two pictures of people in a bad position to generalize that absolutely nobody whos in an extremely bad state self harms he ignores all statistics proving that african americans are found by multiple studies to be the most likely to self injure and says instead that because tumblr is mostly white people all self harmers must be white people he repeatedly says that all self harmers are idiots for not getting therapy again generalising that none of us are in therapy and then he puts us down so much that for me at least he made me feel like i did not deserve help making me self harm much more much worse ending in a suicide attempt and hospitalisation,1

544,hey guys so i do not post here often but i suffer from adhd depression and anxiety so long story short i was diagnosed around october although i should have been diagnosed a long while ago so the first thing i went in for was adhd it took me this long to go in for this i am a sophomore in high school mainly because although i could not pay attention i was smart enough to do well if that makes sense and the main reason i actually did work was because of anxiety especially with my parents being teachers but as i got older starting around middle school the material was getting harder so i had to pay attention to do as well as i normally did and then i hit my lowest lows in high school particularly this year,1

565,your imperfection is not bad at all i am just so happy realizing how beautiful it is to live if you were just to know how to handle it,0
566,lately i have lost a lot of weight and have not been eating like i will get hungry but i just do not feel like eating so i will just wait for the hunger pains to go away by themselves i did not really see a problem with this until people started pointing out that they never see me eating and that i am starting to look unhealthily thin even tho i can not really tell if i look thin or not i have been weighing myself daily and my normal weight used to be lbs and i was around that weight pretty consistently for the past few years but lately i have gone down to lbs and i personally have not been able to see the difference if it was not for the people pointing it out but i want to keep losing weight because i want to see the number on the scale get lower i have had anorexia in the past so my mom has been getting worried about me and asking me to eat more because i am starting to look unhealthy again i am not sure what i should do because i do not want to be anorexic again because the recovery processis hell but at the same time i am afraid of gaining weight,1

569,the biggest disappointment is that no one really understands they assume that i am lazy that i just want to sit around all day and do nothing but the truth is i can not bring myself to the moment i start to think about all of what is been going on both in my world and in my head things fall apart i promised myself that i would stop doing bad things that i would not harm myself or go back to the hospital that i would try to live a normal life hell it may look normal from the outside but there is nothing normal about me,1
570,i feel afraid to talk to them because i worry i am just boring them and i keep looking for signs that they all hate me to a point where i make the most bizarre things into conclusive proof that i am better off alone instead of bothering others with my existence i worry that whenever they are alone they just talk about how fucked up i am and it terrifies me because for all i know they are going to randomly reveal that they have just been faking our friendship all along and i will not have anyone and i will genuinely be completely out of reasons to live,1
571,my little sister drew me this cute picture of our cats and dog ,0
572,i am constantly going all over the place emotionally one second i am okay then i am suddenly extremely depressed and then i am manic then i am overridden by extreme anger or i just feel fucking nothing like there is a hole inside me and i just sit there slicing into my own skin all the fucking time because i have no energy to do anything else and i always lie to people i care about because i want them to care too but i also hate them but i do not and i get so confused and i hate how attached i am to people because it probably scares them even though they might not even know but i think they do and that scares me because then they will leave and i hate it and i have that i am such a lying cutting depressed unstable piece of shit who spends every second of his life having a fucking existential crisis and being afraid of death but also craving it and not knowing what is happening in my head and not taking my meds because i get anxiety around taking them because they could kill me but also maybe not and then of course every time i go for a walk to calm myself,1
573,in my opinion anxiety did not majorly affect me before when i was first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety nos i had a few symptoms for example arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast i was also diagnosed with adhd when i was but i never really felt like i had it i just think it is worth mentioning i am wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow i started zoloft at and took it until last august then i went through some medication changes when i switched to lexapro i was okay for the first two months then something changed i started not feeling like myself one day i just started feeling off while studying for my exam my vision went out of focus a little this put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where things constantly felt off disconnected and detached,1
574,im currently taking lamictal bipolar disorder buspar gad and lexapro depression gad i find they work pretty well except i have mood swings from hell ill be ok one minute and ill want to kill myself the next its pretty terrible,1
575,life is what happens to you and how you react to it,0
576,i thought i would hit my limit a few months ago when i tried to kill myself but compared to now those times seemed like heaven i just can not live anymore you can always say it will get better do not give up you are stronger than this that is all bullshit i am not strong if i was strong i would not have covered my whole body in self harm in the space of less than a year i would not have tried to kill myself i would not be such a failure i have a psychologist a psychiatrist i am on meds my mums supportive i still feel the way i do i am weak i am so weak and useless i had a horrible cutting incident last night i carved failure into my thigh then cut like mad from my thigh all the way up my hip i cut at least times and i am planning something similar tonight i am so scared i know what i can do to myself and i am scared because i know i will do it i do not deserve to feel this way,1
577,came up with this thought during therapy yesterday so i made this today i hope you like it i am thinking it just might be my next tattoo ,0
578,my depression has always involved a lot of self blame guilt and self hatred as well as anger and emptiness i would always take it out on myself first by throwing myself off my bike once when riding down a hill then cutting myself which eventually stemmed into burning scratching and punching walls but recently i have been getting extreme anger towards the people who have hurt me in my past and especially my old school where a lot of very bad events happened to me i am having urges to sneak in one day school is out where i live currently and start smashing windows and breaking computers and just destroying anything i can find in that shithole,1
579,i have had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue for a few years now have not gone to school in six years and i have been homeschooled in the meantime but it is been hard taking everything in due to brain fog just went to my first adult ed class chilled atmosphere and nice people first time having conversations with people that are not family members in a while so that was awesome altogeth i am feeling happier just to get out and see people and to actually learn things easily for the first time in a while ,0
580,my ptsd is caused by many traumas i dealt with in school because of this going to school is nearly impossible i get shakes sweaty i get horrible memories swirling around in my head over and over i become paranoid delusional feel unsafe and like someone is going to hurt me i hear voices that are not there i just cannot deal with it last year when i was attending school regularly i would cut and burn myself every single day many times i tried to hang myself i had breakdowns constantly i ended up in a psych ward where i was told my depression had gotten so bad i was psychotic all because of school the very idea of having to go horrifies me i have not been in about or weeks and i have not tried to kill myself and i am only cutting a couple of times a week but i know my lack of attendance will come back to haunt me at some point,1
581,my thigh is so badly scarred there are like fifty layers of scarring and it is impossible to count how many there are because they overlap so much i do not even know how i managed to do so much damage over only like a year my ankles are pretty damaged too but nowhere near as bad as my thigh and my shoulder was my old favourite place to cut so that is kinda bad too my left forearm is pretty butchered but nothing super bad no idea why i even wrote this i am tired and needed to rant,1
582,money makes the world go round or does it,0
583,i am not sure if this belongs here but i did a bit of rearranging the knick knacks and decorations in my room the other day and it makes me happy ,0
584,i am not entirely sure how this would even work but imagine like a typical razor blade but made out of like a hard sort of rubber and when you used it on yourself it would create sort of fake blood in a line and would look like you cut i am trying to find cutting distractions rn and this would be so amazing i feel probably making no sense sorry and it probably sounds dumb but if it was possible that would be something amazing to be sold for recovering cutters to buy just a dumb idea soz,1
585, last year midyear was one of the toughest times in my life leaving an industry i spent years developing only to leave and unexpectedly rediscover another has been such a fulfilling experience i am grateful for everything i have going for me right now,0
586,i was diagnosed with schizophrenia this year i have visual auditory and physical hallucinations sometimes i believe my teeth are melting out of my head other times i believe people are going to kill and replace my family i have tons of hallucinations some repeatedly show up a huge black bird a man that watches me and shadow people some physical hallucinations include me tasting blood in my mouth or feeling pain from an imaginary knife stabbing me i am on medication and self medicate with cannabis,1
587,i have had major depressive disorder for many years now and it got to the point sometime last year where i did not have the energy or the ability to practice personal hygiene such as showering daily or brushing my teeth i got braces on a few months ago and i am hopeless at caring for them i never used to brush my teeth before i got them on due to my depression and it is just dawned upon me that i have not brushed my teeth in a very long time like at least a week probably two i am already aware my teeth will probably be kind of fucked but is there any chance i might not have those white spots on my teeth when i get my braces off,1

600,honestly its so comforting to hear from other people and know that im not alone in this and that all these quirky symptoms are normal when you are suffering from ptsd my relationship with food my anxiety in the car my nightmares sometimes when i read something someone else wrote im like hey i feel that exactly,1
601,i have medication i take every day for my schizophrenia majority of the time it is a bit of a hassle to get to take them i get the idea that they are poison so my best friend likes to compare it to a video game where she does the right combos to get me to calmly and easily take my medicine and when i do she feels like she unlocks an achievement,1
602,all my life i have struggled with depression but a year ago i have made great strides in over coming mental barriers to move myself forward i am thankful that i have come this far to be more mentally and physically healthy,0
603,i literally can hardly get myself to school in the mornings and end up staying home more often than i should if i can actually get myself there i am alright although still depressed of course but i can usually make it through the day then anyone else like this we re just getting up is the hardest part,1
604,i dont want to live anymore,1
605,we went to the doctors for a checkup and she did some tests on me later said that i lost kilos in a year which is apparently a lot and that im very close to malnutrition i havent been having a healthy relationship with food lately because whenever i eat i feel physically sick nauseous and with a stomachache but ever since the doctor mentioned my weight loss my mom thinks that im making it up i overheard her talking to my dad about it and said something about how i look so skinny im a skeleton which i dont think i am now i dont really have any severe issues with my appearance,1
606,i have been having extreme urges to break into my old school where i experienced a lot of pretty horrible things and i am not looking for people to tell me not to do it what i choose to do is my choice but has anyone else ever had those sorts of urges whether they relate to a person or a place or an object,1
607,i decided to quit chasing childish dreams and buckle down into a desk job quit my overspending and other addictions i also moved back in with my mom thank goodness i had that option its working out for me almost have caught up to where i should be in my retirement savings and it is a huge stress relief im am more mentally physically l and financially healthy than ive been in a long time,0
608,my psychotic depression pushes me to the verge of suicide constantly but my severe anxiety gives me an irrational fear of the unknown including death i am pretty trapped,1
609,i pray god gives you someone who will love and cherish you throughout your life on earth,0
610,i dream every night i dream vividly every night i remember almost all my dreams in the morning i often struggle with differentiating my dreams and real life for example i often have terrible dreams about my so my so is amazing and i almost never have a reason to be uoset with himbut after these dreams i am so pissed of and irritated at him and i question everything he says or doesbut he has done nothing wrong my head is telling me he has betrayed me and i keep trying to tell myself that this was the dream but then i start to believe my lies and its all down hill from there any tips or similar stories,1

614,at work i do not want to be around anyone i do not want to have to talk or force a laugh or make myself smiley like they are used to today i hid away in my office for a majority of the day even brought my work in there so i could sit and listen to my music and break down when i needed to i need to cry i need to breakdown i need to self harm but all of this is impossible because i live at home and my mother has no idea what privacy is,1
615,after years of wanting kids thinking we could not get pregnant unexpectedly becoming pregnant and a horrible childbirth we have this incredible boy who is weeks old today could not be happieror more tired so worth it,0
616,saw this decal on a car and it made me smile found it on amazon so i can do the same for others,0
617,depression was barely even on my radar i knew it existed but i did not think it was common or that i would ever deal with it i do not even know what i thought depression was i might have just thought oh you are just sad a lot now i know how wrong i was,1
618,does anyone know when the proper time is to go to the hospital ive been super depressed and suicidal lately there are moments when it gets really intense and i feel i will follow through with it its gotten to the point where i call the suicide hotline every day because i dont know what else to do,1
619,so tonight was maybe a breakthrough my therapist says it sounds like i have ptsd as well as bipolar ii does anyone else have this going on the bipolar name really frightens me but she says putting me on a mood stabilizer will really really change my quality of life,1
620,i feel like there is a gaping hole in my chest and i just feel completely empty and numb my chest hurts because of how horrible i feel it is like there is a weight on it i have been feeling like this for weeks and i feel like i am rotting i keep trying to reach out for help but i feel like no one is actually helping me because i still feel horrible i am just so hopeless and suicidal because no matter what i do nothing helps and i do not even understand why i am like this,1
621,there is a lot of reposts happening from bots we re on it,0

625,i have this constant urge to break something throw a glass through the window smash my fist through the wall grab a bat and start destroying everything i can see or anything else i just want to destroy things i tend to take my emotions out on myself because i am afraid i would hurt others if i did not but right now i just need to break something smash something anything,1
626,my boyfriend has depression and i want to be a good partner to him he does not talk about it much so i want to hear from you guys what do you appreciate from a partner when it comes to handling your depression,1
627,i have been in therapy for almost a year now for anxiety only not depression but the depression has gotten so bad that i need medication i am destroying relationships left and right and i cannot have that or i will end up alone,1
628,for starters i am not suicidal but to me life has no meaning and i am constantly thinking ahead in life and to the after life it has really made me question my faith as well which is not helping i think if you are religious it can really help you with depression but i just need to find meaning in life and i do not think i could handle doing a job that does not relate to comedy because that is how i find joy in life man that was all over the place,1
629,i have severe anxiety and it blew up into really bad agoraphobia in the past year and a half i spend of my time confined in my room and with barely any social interaction i do not work and am on disability i have had dpdr a few times before when my panic attacks get really bad but lately i think its different like a smell or a tv show or something from a memory of my past will trigger the disconnected feeling and like i am back in that memory the memory is not even particularity traumatic i sometimes will watch tv or a movie and i feel like i am the character and then i start panicking and then that triggers the dpdr i feel like i am gonna go crazy i am scared what is this it it caused from my mind being idle and literally doing nothing but watching netflix hours a day my panic attacks are ruthless because i do not feel like myself at all,1
630,it is common knowledge that self harm feels good but today i had a slight slip up and burnt myself on my thigh it was not too bad only second degree but i have felt extremely euphoric for about half an hour since i did it and this is quite unusual i feel kind of shakey my heart rate has increased a small amount and i feel so happy and relaxed this feeling usually goes away after about or minutes it has not ever lasted this long and i have self injured thousands of times over the last few years i am not complaining i feel amazing but is there a reason this feeling is staying for so long and feels so good this time,1
631,today i completed my final out of state electrical exam and earned my utah journeyman electrician license,0
632,conquering my world learning to love myself finding amazing love in my partner for life after being left by my ex who had at least a dozen affairs do not give up the road can be long and hard but the destination will be worth the journey,0
633,i hate it so much it is literally so fucking boring and i do not even like anyone there i feel like it is just a massive waste of time but at the same time i do want to get better and i am not sure if things will improve over time what i hate is that i can not see my therapist while going to this program which sucks because i like one on one sessions way more than group therapy i am just conflicted on what to do because my therapist really wants me to do this program because she thinks it could really help me but i just can not get into it just being there makes me feel angry and irritable and i do not know how to accept the program so i can actually gain something from it because i have this weird superiority complex that makes me feel like i do not need this program and i do not know how to get over this because deep down i just feel too scared and vulnerable to discuss my emotions infront of a group of people,1
634,i was diagnosed with ptsd stpd and mdd when i was twenty two i would like to go to community college by next year what would be the best course for me,1
635,i posted this in the antidepressants sub but did not hear anything back so it is still early so maybe i just need to push through i would been on mg of citalopram for about years when i went to the doctor because my anxiety was getting worse she had me switch to effexor xr the very next day i have been on mg since and so far my anxiety is unchanged or worse and my depression is coming back hard i am feeling terrible about myself overwhelmed by everything and losing interest is basically everything i like to do normally i love to play video games for hours but now none of them are doing anything for me,1
636,ive had anxiety forever i was diagnosed when i was years old i had trauma recently that resulted in ptsd one thing that my therapist said and i think everyone needs to hear is give yourselves credit for the days you win a lot of us beat ourselves up over the days we have trouble being in public or getting out of bed but we need to give ourselves credit for the days we get out of bed the days we do the thing we have been avoiding the days we win its hard to do these things when experiencing trauma,1
637, was quite simply the worst year of my life i was diagnosed with clinical depression late but the problems surmounted the past year came back home after graduating thought things would finally change butbad breakup with the love of my life unemployment and repeated repeated rejections problems at home had a ligament tearit goes on and on wanted to start afresh the new decade but it just plummeted lower and lower interviewed for this really awesome job last week but still have not been gotten back to so i think that is that my last chance at some redemption is gone im gonna have to stay home in this fucked up environment been shutting myself off everything but a close friend invited me to his party today so ended up going we were on the terrace smoking a fag and at a time it was only me there then all the pentup frustration let loose all the failures had taken a toll and i broke down went to the edge said some words and was just about to jump when i saw s mething flash by me a white trail of light was not a bird or paper or anything my mind became even more blank but instead of jumping i staggered back and fell back on the floor,1

640,my mental hell began months ago i feel like something in my mind broke and do you know the reason i heard of someone who died by suicide since then my life changed completely i do not know why i do not know how i do not know what to do next i suddenly asked myself why he did it he had kids he had everything what kind of force drive him to suicide what stops me from doing it too and then i experienced something strange something confusing i have really hard time describing what is happening in my brainnearly impossible but i will try life feels meaningless without any apparent reason i am constantly anxious have less energy i do not go outside as i used to i am constantly in my home searching google articles about mental issues and so on i am constantly in my head,1
641,i try my hardest to act like everything is good but it is not i am lonely and miserable i get angry because i am lonely and miserable if i died today i know deep down that i would be forgotten within months not a word about me i know why but it still hurts to know how invaluable i am to everyone i try so hard to fit in to make new friends there is just so much about me that is unlikable and i know that it is not the depression talking i have seen it for myself in peoples eyes and in their body signals i want to live but unemployment depression sadness and anger around the clock is not a life worth living i can not even see death as an escape there is no escape for this i am going to be a shell no matter what,1

646,i am an elementary music teacher not a reading teacher but i am helping out with the rd grade reading because i have some extra time in my day and i wanted to be useful during first quarter only of the rd grade students were on grade level to pass the state assessment that is not good so we worked really really hard and devised some new interventions we just got our test scores back from second quarter and it jumped to over of the students being on grade level i am so proud of them,0
647,i saw a new psychiatrist today to go over a new treatment plan for my ptsd i was prescribed your typical antidepressants klonopin but was also prescribed prazosin mg from my understanding it was initially a blood pressure drug but is also used to help get rid of nightmares for ptsd patients and help me sleep,1

650,does anyone else do this i have self harmed in different ways throughout my life as a kid i heard voices had bizarre nonsensical paranoid beliefs and did not know how to function in social situations and i remember hitting myself in the head when i got stressed or purposely pissing off my cat and then putting my hand near him and letting him tear it to shreds or grinding my hand against a wall until it left marks when i was i began cutting eventually began burning too got a couple thousand scars as a result i do not do it a ton anymore but i have been punching walls daily for a while now and i do not know why but it is just so satisfying getting pissed off and just being able to slam my fist into a wall seeing the bruising maybe even bleeding it just feels good i know i have potential to do real damage and i have already accidentally knocked a tendon out of place doing it but it just feels satisfying anyone else got experience with this,1
