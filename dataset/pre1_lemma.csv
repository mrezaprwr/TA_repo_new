1,like most people here i have experienced significant weight gain since starting seroquel a few month ago to the point where i am considering changing med i have spoken to a couple of my doctor about this and the concern i have surrounding it but they seem to believe that it is not that bad that i need to gain weight anyway so i might a well let it happen while i do have a thin frame that is a natural thing putting on weight will not make me grow out i will just get a belly and it will not look good not to mention be unhealthy but because of this thin frame they refuse to give me anything to halt the weight gain is there anything i can do to change their mind or at least have something to stop the weight gain no matter how much i eat i will put on weight i went a few day without food and still put on weight imnot sure how bad it is going to get and i really need something to help,1

110,hello everyone i have had anxiety problem a far back a year old i am now and a couple month ago in addition to wellbutrin prescribed month before this for my depression i wa prescribed remeron to help with anxiety after a week or two i started missing dos and had my first panic attack which wa just awful for the first few minute it felt like a heart burn which i used to get so i did not think about it i started rubbing my chest to alleviate the feeling then out of no where the attack came and felt like someone grabbed my heart and squeezed it this wa then followed my the feeling of my heart pouring out blood and then then tension in the heartchest area and dizziness for the rest of the day,1
111,so a very basic rundown of my mental illness history i am a year old male who ha had anxiety issue my whole life but morphed into severe social anxiety disorder year ago i have had major depressive disorder for year and i wa recently told by my psychologist that i appear to be a selfaware borderline i have struggled with pretty severe self harm for about a year now and i have covered myself in scar i have made a couple of suicide attempt due to all of this and i have noticed that recently maybe over the past month i have been extremely short tempered and will get very angry at people for the slightest thing especially my parent i have told them that i can not control the anger multiple time but they keep just believing that i am using that a an excuse to be an asshole truth is i really cannot control myself when i am in this angry state,1

323,ive been told by close friend and family that i tend to disassociate but im not really sure if i do or not ive never been told any of this by a psychologist or anyone certified to diagnose also i dont think that ive been in a traumatic event i wa in an very toxic romantic relationship not so long ago but it never got to physical abuse it wa really emotionally draining and hurtful though,1
324,so i work at a jr high school we have one incredibly emotionally unstable student he will come in to the counseling office where i work a the nurse and just wail it not normal cry and he can turn it off and on like a switch so several day during the week he will come in and turn on this wail the kid turn off the wail a soon a his mom complies with what he want he is extremely manipulative the wailing though it brings me right back to the abuse the wailing sound exactly like myself and my sibling when we were suffering the abuse yesterday he wa in the office just screaming and wailing and we had to have police officer come in and try to manage it before he wa taken to a hospital it caused a panic attack,1
325,the ward is a couple of hour away so it will be a long drive i am kind of excited in a weird way i might finally be in the hand of people who can help me i wa recently diagnosed with rapidcycling bipolar disorder which wa a bit surprising i always thought i just had depressionanxiety but i guess this explains those period of time where i am extremely energetic to the point where i begin being extremely impulsive and basically idiotic my cutting will finally be put under control no more covering myself in scar to purposely ruin my body at least no more of that for a few week it will be an interesting experience it will fuck with my schooling a fair bit but my mental illness already fucked over my education enough anyway and this might be a start to my recovery,1

572,i am constantly going all over the place emotionally one second i am okay then i am suddenly extremely depressed and then i am manic then i am overridden by extreme anger or i just feel fucking nothing like there is a hole inside me and i just sit there slicing into my own skin all the fucking time because i have no energy to do anything else and i always lie to people i care about because i want them to care too but i also hate them but i do not and i get so confused and i hate how attached i am to people because it probably scare them even though they might not even know but i think they do and that scare me because then they will leave and i hate it and i have that i am such a lying cutting depressed unstable piece of shit who spends every second of his life having a fucking existential crisis and being afraid of death but also craving it and not knowing what is happening in my head and not taking my med because i get anxiety around taking them because they could kill me but also maybe not and then of course every time i go for a walk to calm myself,1
573,in my opinion anxiety did not majorly affect me before when i wa first diagnosed with dysthymia and anxiety no i had a few symptom for example arriving late to school would make my stomach hurt and walking into class my heartbeat would be very fast i wa also diagnosed with adhd when i wa but i never really felt like i had it i just think it is worth mentioning i am wondering if it contributes to all of this somehow i started zoloft at and took it until last august then i went through some medication change when i switched to lexapro i wa okay for the first two month then something changed i started not feeling like myself one day i just started feeling off while studying for my exam my vision went out of focus a little this put me in a heightened state of anxiety for the next month or so where thing constantly felt off disconnected and detached,1
